This work aims to categorize consumer turnover in banks by using a new ensemble approach combining many machine learning methods, hence enhancing churn prediction models. Using a comprehensive dataset including demographic, financial, and behavioral data—such as credit score, account balance, tenure, and activity levels—the study employs the goal variable revealing if a customer has left the bank. The study starts with univariate, bivariate, and multivariate feature exploration and subsequently uses the Interquartile Range (IQR) approach to identify outliers thereby improving the data quality. Five models—K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost—a Voting Classifier ensemble—are used to estimate project churn. Building upon all the strengths of each model, this approach improves the prediction of classification and provides a balanced and highly robust classification system. The applied approaches are K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost within a Voting Classifier configuration. The performance of the Voting Classifier without SMOTE yields the following results: Accuracy: 0.87, precision: 0.87, recall: 0.80, and F1-Score: 0.87. The proposed model that extend the base model using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), yields a higher prediction accuracy of 0.90, precision of 0.90, recall of 0.90 and F1-Score of 0.90. This enhancement is proving the efficiency of SMOTE to handle the class imbalance problem in order to render the churn prediction more balanced and reliable system. The proposed approach assures a reliable solution to the strategies to retain the customers in the banking organisations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Challenges In Statistical Methods; Empowerment; Ensemble Methods; Explainability; Inclusivity; Insights Into Customer Behavior; Machine Learning Models; Resilience; Sustainability; Banking; Consumption Behavior; Demography; Empowerment; Machine Learning; Numerical Model; Prediction; Statistical Analysis; Sustainability","banking; consumption behavior; demography; empowerment; machine learning; numerical model; prediction; statistical analysis; sustainability","","","","Journal of Applied Microeconometrics, (2021); Advances in Machine Learning and Computational Intelligence, (2021); Dalmia, Hemlata, Churning of Bank Customers Using Supervised Learning, Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, 107, pp. 681-691, (2020); Tran, Hoang Anh, CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION IN THE BANKING SECTOR USING MACHINE LEARNING-BASED CLASSIFICATION MODELS, Interdisciplinary Journal of Information, Knowledge, and Management, 18, pp. 87-105, (2023); Rahman, Manas, Machine Learning Based Customer Churn Prediction in Banking, pp. 1196-1201, (2020); Tekouabou, Stéphane Cédric Koumetio, Towards Explainable Machine Learning for Bank Churn Prediction Using Data Balancing and Ensemble-Based Methods, Mathematics, 10, 14, (2022); Shukla, Animesh, Application of Machine Learning and Statistics in Banking Customer Churn Prediction, pp. 37-41, (2021); Singh, Pahul Preet, Investigating customer churn in banking: A machine learning approach and visualization app for data science and management, Data Science and Management, 7, 1, pp. 7-16, (2024); Sagala, Noviyanti Tri Maretta, Enhanced Churn Prediction Model with Boosted Trees Algorithms in the Banking Sector, pp. 240-245, (2021); Masrom, Suraya, Analysis of Machine Learning in Classifying Bank Profitability with Corruption Factor, Journal of Advanced Research in Applied Sciences and Engineering Technology, 40, 2, pp. 13-21, (2024)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","26629984","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217877173"

Alternative Augmentative Communication (AAC) strategies based on synthetic voices have been shown to assist patients in maintaining communication and improving their Quality of Life (QoL). However, such synthetic voices are often perceived as impersonal and fail to capture the unique voice and identity of the patient. To tackle this issue, combining voice banking (VB) and artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a more natural communication strategy, enabling individuals to preserve their voice for use with AAC devices as needed. This involves recording speech samples to generate a synthetic voice closely resembling the individual’s own. Despite the increasing interest in VB, there’s a lack of clear strategies for its effective implementation in rapidly progressing diseases like ALS. Additionally, the perceptual quality of VB on patients with preserved speech, especially when offered early in the disease, remains poorly understood. In light of these challenges, this study aims to assess the effectiveness and the perceptual impact of AI-generated voices on ALS patients with preserved speech, utilizing a personalized voice synthesis system based on machine learning. The AI-generated patient-specific voice is achieved through voice recording, followed by fine-tuning using a Generative Adversarial Network for Efficient and High Fidelity Speech Synthesis (HiFi-GAN), resulting in a model capable of producing speech highly similar to the patient’s own voice, with exceptional expressive and audio quality. By addressing these aspects, this study intends to offer valuable insights into the potential benefits and challenges of combining VB with AI voices to enhance communication support for ALS patients. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alternative Augmentative Communication; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Artificial Intelligence; Hifi-gan; Synthetic Voice; Voice Banking; Voice Generation; Adult; Aged; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Artificial Intelligence; Communication Aid; Complication; Female; Human; Male; Middle Aged; Pathophysiology; Physiology; Psychology; Quality Of Life; Speech; Therapy; Voice; Adult; Aged; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Artificial Intelligence; Communication Aids For Disabled; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Quality Of Life; Speech; Voice","adult; aged; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; artificial intelligence; communication aid; complication; female; human; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; psychology; quality of life; speech; therapy; voice; Adult; Aged; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Artificial Intelligence; Communication Aids for Disabled; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Speech; Voice","","","We are grateful to AISLA - Associazione Italiana Sclerosi Laterale Amiotrofica for supporting NeMO Lab \u201CVoice of purpose\u201D research projects.

The incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) in the financial sector has brought transformative changes, particularly in the adoption and usage of CBDCs. Therefore, this study explores the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on consumers’ intentions toward adopting CBDCs in the Chinese banking sector through digital technology awareness, addressing privacy concerns, and ease of use with the moderating role of government support. This research study examined the relationships of a sample of 420 employees in the Chinese banking sector. The current study uses the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method to assess these parameters. The findings show that artificial intelligence positively impacts consumers’ willingness to use CBDCs in the Chinese banking sector through digital technology awareness, addressing privacy concerns, and ease of use. Furthermore, government support significantly influences the link between AI, digital technology awareness, addressing privacy concerns, and ease of use. This study contributes to the literature on digital currency adoption by highlighting the critical role of AI in enhancing user experiences and trust in financial innovations. It also provides practical insights for policymakers and financial institutions to leverage AI technologies to strategically foster CBDCs adoption in China. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This work received financial support from the Beijing Social Science Foundation [No. 24JCB028].","Ahamad, Shahanawaj, The Critical Role Played by Big Data Management in Effectively Addressing the Security and Overall Privacy Concerns Through Correlation Analysis, pp. 130-134, (2022); Akin, Isik, The ripple effects of CBDC-related news on Bitcoin returns: Insights from the DCC-GARCH model, Research in International Business and Finance, 66, (2023); Aldboush, Hassan Hamad Hasan, Building Trust in Fintech: An Analysis of Ethical and Privacy Considerations in the Intersection of Big Data, AI, and Customer Trust, International Journal of Financial Studies, 11, 3, (2023); Alfar, Abdelrahman J.K., The determinants of issuing central bank digital currencies, Research in International Business and Finance, 64, (2023); Allen, Franklin, Fintech, Cryptocurrencies, and CBDC: Financial Structural Transformation in China, Journal of International Money and Finance, 124, (2022); Allwood, Carl Martin, The distinction between qualitative and quantitative research methods is problematic, Quality and Quantity, 46, 5, pp. 1417-1429, (2012); Náñez Alonso, Sergio Luis, Reasons fostering or discouraging the implementation of central bank-backed digital currency: A review, Economies, 8, 2, (2020); Náñez Alonso, Sergio Luis, Central banks digital currency: Detection of optimal countries for the implementation of a CBDC and the implication for payment industry open innovation, Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity, 7, 1, pp. 1-23, (2021); Anser, Muhammad Khalid, Exploring the nexuses between international entrepreneurship and sustainable development of organizational goals: mediating role of artificial intelligence technologies, Environment, Development and Sustainability, (2024); Babin, Barry J., Heresies and sacred cows in scholarly marketing publications, Journal of Business Research, 69, 8, pp. 3133-3138, (2016)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","26629992","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008106724"

Traditional anti-telecom fraud models, which primarily rely on expert rules and machine learning methodologies, are beset with limitations such as poor real-time performance and high false favourable rates, leading to biased predictive outcomes. This paper introduces a novel anti-fraud model: The Dynamic Quantification Anti-Fraud Model grounded in Real-time Transaction Flows to address these issues. This model combines multiple F-Beta features linearly, employs a DML (Double Machine Learning) framework for feature weight quantification, and conducts instantaneous risk assessments of account transactions. By dynamically adjusting feature weights based on historical single-feature false favourable rates and the branch’s anti-fraud tolerance capacity, it significantly improves model performance and the efficiency of fraud prevention. Using transaction detail data of implicated cards from a case bank spanning January to June 2023 as an example for modelling, the validation sample recall rate reached 0.506. Post-deployment, the model facilitated a 30-percentage point reduction in the proportion of implicated cards within six months at the bank, alongside a substantial drop in its ranking among peers concerning the number of fraud cases. This comprehensive improvement solidly validates the precision and efficacy of the proposed model. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anti-fraud Model; Double Machine Learning; Dynamic Quantification; Implicated Card Prediction; Real-time Transaction Streams","","","","","J Hum Arts Soc Sci, (2024); J Pol L, (2024); World J Adv Res Rev, (2024); Advances in Cybersecurity Strategies for Financial Institutions A Focus on Combating E Channel Fraud in the Digital Era, (2024); Zhang, Yu, Criminal law regulation of cyber fraud crimes—from the perspective of citizens’ personal information protection in the era of edge computing, Journal of Cloud Computing, 12, 1, (2023); Int J Hum Soc Sci; Aggarwal, Meenakshi, Federated Learning on Internet of Things: Extensive and Systematic Review, Computers, Materials and Continua, 79, 2, pp. 1795-1834, (2024); Hossain, Emam, Machine learning with Belief Rule-Based Expert Systems to predict stock price movements, Expert Systems with Applications, 206, (2022); Ali, Abdulalem, Financial Fraud Detection Based on Machine Learning: A Systematic Literature Review, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 12, 19, (2022); Jaculine Priya, G., Fraud detection and prevention using machine learning algorithms: A review, pp. 564-568, (2021)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","29482992","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003970609"

In service infrastructure or economic management, the challenge of making judgments and processing data inefficiently in unpredictable markets is the drawback of the existing approach. Technology-related constraints, such as scalability and connectivity issues, can hinder the application's functionality and ability to adapt to changing market conditions. Scalability and connectivity constraints can impact applications related to online banking, digital transactions, and financial data processing. This study explores the use of Mothfly Optimized Improved Long Short-Term Memory (MO-ILSTM) as a data classification technique to improve data sharing and processing effectiveness. The proposed approach overcomes the above mentioned constraints. The capacity of LSTM to identify long-range relationships in sequential data is restricted. By boosting data processing and decision-making in service infrastructure or economic management amid market volatility, MO-ILSTM aims to increase long-range dependency capture. The ILSTM approach is extended from binary data classification to various classifications, addressing the inability of economic management or service infrastructure to efficiently handle complex data processing needs and ensure prompt decision-making. The proposed research is to better predict risk, process data more efficiently, integrate economic services into the banking sector, and improve economic management and service infrastructure to lessen the effects of the financial crisis. Tests show that the ILSTM-based economic management and service infrastructure can decrease economic threat by 18 %, increase service quality by 32 %, and increase the degree of integrated economic service by 45 %. The platform can also effectively forecast financial risks, with a prediction accuracy of 75.6 % due to information exchange and interaction.

This study explores the potential of Time Series Classification (TSC) algorithms to enhance credit risk modeling by analyzing customers’ historical end-of-day balance data. We compare traditional Machine Learning (ML) models – including Logistic Regression and XGBoost – with advanced TSC methods such as Shapelets, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Canonical Interval Forests (CIF). Our results show that TSC algorithms, particularly CIF and Shapelet-based methods, significantly outperform traditional approaches. When using CIF-derived Probability of Default (PD) estimates as additional features in an XGBoost model, predictive performance improved notably: the combined model achieved an Area under the Curve (AUC) of 0.81, compared to 0.79 for CIF alone and 0.77 for XGBoost without the CIF input. These findings underscore the value of integrating temporal features into credit risk assessment frameworks. Moreover, the complementary strengths of the TSC and XGBoost models across different Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve regions demonstrate the practical benefits of model stacking. However, performance dropped when using aggregated monthly data, highlighting the importance of preserving high-frequency behavioral signals. This research contributes to more accurate, interpretable, and robust credit risk models and offers a pathway for banks to leverage time series data for improved risk forecasting. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consumers’ Credit Risk Assessment; Hybrid Machine Learning; Probability Of Default; Retail Banking; Time Series Classification; Banking; Classification (of Information); Learning Systems; Logistic Regression; Long Short-term Memory; Risk Management; Sales; Time Series; Classification Algorithm; Consumer Credit Risks; Consumer’ Credit Risk Assessment; Credit Risk Assessment; Credit Risk Modeling; Hybrid Machine Learning; Probability Of Defaults; Retail Banking; Shapelets; Time Series Classifications; Risk Assessment","Banking; Classification (of information); Learning systems; Logistic regression; Long short-term memory; Risk management; Sales; Time series; Classification algorithm; Consumer credit risks; Consumer’ credit risk assessment; Credit risk assessment; Credit risk modeling; Hybrid machine learning; Probability of defaults; Retail banking; Shapelets; Time series classifications; Risk assessment","","","Funding text 1: We gratefully acknowledge the support of the Marie Sk\u0142odowskaCurie Actions under the European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation program for the Industrial Doctoral Network on Digital Finance, acronym: DIGITAL, Project No. 101119635.

Specifically, we use ChatGPT to analyse and interpret loan assessments written by loan officers and generate refined versions of these texts. Our comparative analysis reveals significant differences between generative artificial intelligence (AI)-refined and human-written texts in terms of text length, semantic similarity, and linguistic representations. Using deep learning techniques, we show that incorporating unstructured text data, particularly ChatGPT-refined texts, alongside conventional structured data significantly enhances credit default predictions. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the contents of both human-written and ChatGPT-refined assessments contribute to the models’ prediction and show that the effect of essential words is highly context-dependent. Moreover, we find that ChatGPT's analysis of borrower delinquency contributes the most to improving predictive accuracy. We also evaluate the business impact of the models based on human-written and ChatGPT-refined texts, and find that, in most cases, the latter yields higher profitability than the former.

The objective is to determine the optimal dimensionless transverse and longitudinal pitches that establish a proper compromise between heat transfer enhancement and pressure drop minimization across a wide range of inlet Reynolds numbers (1,000-50,000). Tube banks simulations are performed for randomly selected pairs of design points to generate data on Nusselt number and friction factor. This dataset is used to train neural networks, which predict heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics as functions of dimensionless pitches. Appropriate objective functions are defined using trained neural networks and integrated into Genetic Algorithm to efficiently identify Pareto-optimal solutions. Results indicate that Reynolds number has a negligible effect on the Pareto front, as the optimal trade-offs between heat transfer and pressure drop remain consistent across different flow regimes. The best point on the Pareto front, defined as the solution with the minimum distance to the utopia point, exhibits dimensionless longitudinal and transverse pitches of approximately 0.90 and 1.30, respectively, regardless of the Reynolds number. Additionally, the study confirms that compact tube banks with dimensionless longitudinal pitches smaller than 1.0, often excluded in experimental and numerical studies, can be successfully simulated and optimized using the proposed framework. The findings provide practical guidelines for designing high-efficiency staggered tube banks and demonstrate a computationally efficient approach to optimize heat exchanger configurations without relying on empirical correlations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cross-flow Staggered Tube Banks; Genetic Algorithm; Heat Transfer; Machine Learning; Multi-objective Optimization","","","","","Abed, N., A CFD study of flow quantities and heat transfer by changing a vertical to diameter ratio and horizontal to diameter ratio in inline tube banks using URANS turbulence models, International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer, 89, pp. 18-30, (2017); Aiba, Shin'ya, HEAT TRANSFER AROUND TUBES IN STAGGERED TUBE BANKS., Bulletin of the JSME, 25, 204, pp. 927-933, (1982); Bacellar, Daniel, Airside friction and heat transfer characteristics for staggered tube bundle in crossflow configuration with diameters from 0.5 mm to 2.0 mm, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 98, pp. 448-454, (2016); Bejan, Adrian, The optimal spacing for cylinders in crossflow forced convection, Journal of Heat Transfer, 117, 3, pp. 767-770, (1995); Bejan, Adrian, The optimal spacing between horizontal cylinders in a fixed volume cooled by natural convection, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 38, 11, pp. 2047-2055, (1995); Optimization Concepts and Applications in Engineering, (2011); Burden, Frank Robert, Bayesian regularization of neural networks, Methods in Molecular Biology, 458, pp. 25-44, (2008); Deng, Zhiwei, Numerical simulation study on the resistance and heat transfer performance of anti-icing device of fin-staggered tube structure in marine intake system, Applied Thermal Engineering, 244, (2024); Fang, Yongsheng, A review of tournament selection in genetic programming, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 6382 LNCS, M4D, pp. 181-192, (2010); Fundamentals of Neural Networks Architectures Algorithms and Applications, (2006)","","Isfahan University of Technology","","","","","","17353645; 17353572","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015220258"

In a two-period model, bank loans in the first period build up banks’ financing experience with the novel technology, which improves lending profitability and partially spills over to peers. Because of these learning externalities, such early-stage loans are either undersupplied by the market (a cooperation problem) or do not occur at all if the banking sector remains stuck in an inferior market equilibrium with no lending (a coordination problem). We propose a policy mix in which public loan provision eliminates the inferior equilibrium, thereby resolving the coordination problem, while de-risking subsidies internalize learning spillovers to peers. Our findings highlight the role of public financial policies if environmental and innovation externalities are already addressed, and we provide a numerical application to the early stage of offshore wind energy in Germany as a plausible context for our policy implications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Climate Policy; Credit Guarantees; Government Loans; Multiple Equilibria; Offshore Wind; Renewable Energy; Social Tipping Point; State Investment Bank; Banking; Energy Policy; Environmental Protection; Investments; Climate Policy; Credit Guarantee; De-risking; Government Loans; Investment Bank; Multiple Equilibrium; Offshore Winds; Renewable Energies; Social Tipping Point; State Investment Bank; Commerce; Alternative Energy; Cost Analysis; Environmental Policy; Innovation; Investment; Machine Learning; Mobility; Offshoring; Policy Implementation; Spillover Effect; Germany","Banking; Energy policy; Environmental protection; Investments; Climate policy; Credit guarantee; De-risking; Government loans; Investment bank; Multiple equilibrium; Offshore winds; Renewable energies; Social tipping point; State investment bank; Commerce; alternative energy; cost analysis; environmental policy; innovation; investment; machine learning; mobility; offshoring; policy implementation; spillover effect; Germany","","","For valuable comments, the authors thank participants at the EAERE 2023 Annual Conference, the 9th Atlantic Workshop on Energy and Environmental Economics 2022, the YEEES Spring Seminar 2022, the 2024 International Symposium on Climate, Finance and Sustainability, and two anynomous reviewers.

Effective strategic planning requires precise estimation and prediction of the performance for each operation. The present study designed a mixed-network structure of banking operations that integrates operational reserves and diversified financial services, including fund deployment and digital/non-digital services. A directional distance function -based network data envelopment analysis (DEA) model is proposed to comprehensively evaluate the profit efficiency of individual divisions and the overall system, considering competitive scenarios with varying input costs and output prices, undesirable outputs, and handling negative data. Further, value-based input–output targets are derived for providing improvement path to inefficient units. To address the computational complexities of network DEA, machine learning techniques namely, support vector regression and artificial neural network have been merged with the proposed framework to forecast the profit efficiency of newly added banks. This methodology has been applied to the Indian banking sector over fiscal years 2013-2023, using a five-year DEA window analysis. The findings show a consistent upward trend in profit efficiency across all divisions, with banks improving their capabilities in fund generation, deployment, and digital/non-digital services. Additionally, the integrated approach yields highly accurate profit efficiency predictions evaluated for window W7 (2019–2023). Moreover, as evidenced by metrics like mean square error ANN has outperformed SVR in performance and accuracy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Neural Network (ann); Directional Distance Function (ddf); Indian Banking Sector; Network Data Envelopment Analysis (dea); Profit Efficiency; Support Vector Machine For Regression (svr)","","","","","AlKhars, Mohammed A., A Survey of DEA Window Analysis Applications, Processes, 10, 9, (2022); An, Qingxian, Profit inefficiency decomposition in a serial-structure system with resource sharing, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 70, 12, pp. 2112-2126, (2019); An, Yunfei, SVR-DEA model of carbon tax pricing for China's thermal power industry, Science of the Total Environment, 734, (2020); Antunes, Jorge Junio Moreira, Bank efficiency estimation in China: DEA-RENNA approach, Annals of Operations Research, 315, 2, pp. 1373-1398, (2022); Asif, Mohammad, The Impact of Fintech and Digital Financial Services on Financial Inclusion in India, Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 16, 2, (2023); Athanassopoulos, Antreas D., A comparison of data envelopment analysis and artificial neural networks as tools for assessing the efficiency of decision making units, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 47, 8, pp. 1000-1016, (1996); Efficient Learning Machines, (2015); International Journal of Data Envelopment Analysis, (2013); Econometrica, (1988); Banker, Rajiv D., SOME MODELS FOR ESTIMATING TECHNICAL AND SCALE INEFFICIENCIES IN DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS., Management Science, 30, 9, pp. 1078-1092, (1984)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","18661505; 11092858","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007245436"

Their estimation and evaluation rely on labeled data from previously accepted clients. Ignoring rejected applicants with unknown repayment behavior introduces sampling bias, as the available labeled data only partially represents the population of potential borrowers. This paper examines the impact of sampling bias and introduces new methods to mitigate its adverse effect. First, we develop a bias-aware self-labeling algorithm for scorecard training, which debiases the training data by adding selected rejects with an inferred label. Second, we propose a Bayesian framework to address sampling bias in scorecard evaluation. To provide reliable projections of future scorecard performance, we include rejected clients with random pseudo-labels in the test set and use Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the scorecard's expected performance across label realizations. We conduct extensive experiments using both synthetic and observational data. The observational data includes an unbiased sample of applicants accepted without scoring, representing the true borrower population and facilitating a realistic assessment of reject inference techniques. The results show that our methods outperform established benchmarks in predictive accuracy and profitability. Additional sensitivity analysis clarifies the conditions under which they are most effective. Comparing the relative effectiveness of addressing sampling bias during scorecard training versus evaluation, we find the latter much more promising. For example, we estimate the expected return per dollar issued to increase by up to 2.07 and up to 5.76 percentage points when using bias-aware self-labeling and Bayesian evaluation, respectively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Credit Scoring; Machine Learning; Or In Banking; Reject Inference; Sampling Bias; Decision Making; Markov Processes; Credit Scoring; Credit Scoring Model; Labeled Data; Machine-learning; Observational Data; Or In Banking; Performance; Reject Inference; Sampling Bias; Scoring Models; Sensitivity Analysis","Decision making; Markov processes; Credit scoring; Credit scoring model; Labeled data; Machine-learning; Observational data; OR in banking; Performance; Reject inference; Sampling bias; Scoring models; Sensitivity analysis","","","","Alfonso-Sánchez, Sherly, Optimizing credit limit adjustments under adversarial goals using reinforcement learning, European Journal of Operational Research, 315, 2, pp. 802-817, (2024); Anderson, Billie S., A Monte Carlo simulation framework for reject inference, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 74, 4, pp. 1133-1149, (2023); undefined, (2018); Athey, Susan, Policy Learning With Observational Data, Econometrica, 89, 1, pp. 133-161, (2021); Banasik, John L., Credit scoring, augmentation and lean models, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 56, 9, pp. 1072-1081, (2005); Banasik, John L., Reject inference, augmentation, and sample selection, European Journal of Operational Research, 183, 3, pp. 1582-1594, (2007); Banasik, John L., Sample selection bias in credit scoring models, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 54, 8, pp. 822-832, (2003); Borgwardt, Karsten M., Integrating structured biological data by Kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy, Bioinformatics, 22, 14, pp. e49-e57, (2006); Bravo, Cristián, Granting and managing loans for micro-entrepreneurs: New developments and practical experiences, European Journal of Operational Research, 227, 2, pp. 358-366, (2013); undefined, (2001)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","03772217","","EJORD","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003028359"

The study employed the Panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag (Panel ARDL) model, relying on four indicators that capture essential aspects of banking risk: (Capital Adequacy Ratio(CAR), Cash Liquidity Ratio(CLR), Non-Performing Loans ratio(NPL), and Credit Deployment Ratio(CDR). The empirical analysis covers a sample of three Iraqi commercial banks listed on the Iraq Stock Exchange, using quarterly data for the period 2018-2023. The findings reveal a statistically significant long-run relationship between the Kida index and the selected financial indicators, while the error correction term confirms a moderate speed of adjustment toward equilibrium following financial shocks. Considering the accelerating developments in artificial intelligence (AI), this study underscores the potential for integrating the Kida model into intelligent analytical systems capable of real-time monitoring and predictive assessment of financial distress, based on continuous and automated data feeding. Such an integration—leveraging machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, neural networks) and real-time data processing platforms-could significantly enhance the ability of decision-makers to detect early signs of financial distress and respond more proactively. The study concludes that the Kida model, when aligned with critical financial indicators, serves as an effective tool for assessing financial risk. It recommends the periodic adoption of this approach within the Iraqi banking sector, while highlighting the future strategic role of AI in strengthening early-warning mechanisms and data-driven financial governance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Financial Failure; Financial Indicators; Iraqi Banks; Kida Model","","","","","Quarterly and Annual Financial Reports of Bank of Baghdad National Bank of Iraq and Al Mansour Bank Quarterly Annual Reports, (2018); Public Financial Disclosures of Bank of Baghdad National Bank of Iraq and Al Mansour Bank Listed Company Reports, (2018); Turkish Journal of Computer and Mathematics Education, (2021); Finanse Rynki Finansowe Ubezpieczenia, (2015); Financial Management, (1992); Journal Riset Ekonomi Manajemen Bisnis Dan Akuntansi, (2019); South African Journal of Human Resource Management, (2005); Risk Management in Banking, (2002); European Journal of Accounting Auditing and Finance Research, (2019); Investments, (2002)","","Science Publishing Corporation Inc.","","","","","","23094508","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011520698"

We also explore the complex configurations of these factors, which collectively improve ESP. Grounded in the stimulus–organism–response and affordance theories, we employ a hybrid methodology combining structural equation modelling and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to analyse data from an online survey. Our findings indicate that AI adoption significantly boosts ESP in the banking sector, primarily mediated by sustainable banking and green innovation, despite Fintech showing no significant direct impact on ESP.

It reduces the degree of credit risk misjudgement caused by the weak correlation between evaluation indicators and default status and imbalanced data. Based on the empirical analysis of 8624 farmers' data from a commercial bank in China, the average rank of the OPSO-GINI-FS model designed from the feature dimension is 1.29, which is higher than that of the OPSO-GINI-IS model designed from the indicator dimension (1.57). This means that our model has a higher default risk identification ability than the traditional one. And the META-SAMPLER method of processing imbalanced data is also promising. Moreover, we found the machine learning designed in this paper has a higher ability to identify farmers' loan default than the traditional econometric methods.

This study aims to assess the customer perceptions, attitude, and response towards AI-driven e-services of New Generation banks and to examine the customers’ acceptance of AI-driven e-services of select New Generation banks. A sample size of 351 customers is determined and data collection is executed through structured interview schedules, ensuring respondent anonymity to encourage honest feedback. The results were analysed by using Structural Equation Modelling. The study reveals that respondents generally hold positive perceptions of AI-driven e-services in banking, emphasizing the importance of efficiency, trust, user experience, personalization, and satisfaction. Efficiency and personalization, in particular, are highlighted for their roles in expediting transactions and delivering tailored advice, respectively. However, the lower R-square value indicates the customer’s inherent reluctance of using technology due to their concern regarding data privacy. Hence, the bank should focus on safety and security which is critical to maintain customer trust and thereby increasing customer acceptance level of AI technology-based banking services.

This study aims to comprehend and investigate the presence of AI in Malaysian asset management, its evolution in relation to current traditional practices, and its performance. A mixed-methods approach was employed. Qualitative text analysis was conducted on 702 fund reports and official AMC documents to identify the presence of AI technologies and their role in transforming traditional practices. Quantitative methods were utilised to evaluate performance: user ratings of robo-advisor applications were analysed to measure adoption and satisfaction, while Welch's t-test compared the annual returns of AI-driven and human-managed equity funds to assess performance. This study identified two prominent AI in asset management: robo-advisors and AI-driven funds. Robo-advisors automate investor profiling and fund recommendations, whereas AI-driven funds use algorithms for autonomous trading decisions. AI adoption varies among asset management companies (AMCs), with differing levels of integration. This transformation has supplanted traditional unit trust consultants (UTCs) with robo-advisors and human fund managers with AI-driven funds. Preliminary findings indicate high user satisfaction with robo-advisors because of their efficacy and convenience. AI-driven funds yield annual returns comparable to those of human-managed funds in the equity category, demonstrating their proficiency in managing complex investment strategies. These findings illuminate AI's transformative potential in asset management, suggesting it could replace traditional roles and achieve competitive performance. This study lays the groundwork for future research on AI's long-term impact and scalability in the industry, enriching the understanding of AI's evolving role in finance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai-driven Fund; Artificial Intelligence; Asset Management; Investment; Robo-advisor","","","","","Abdullah, Fikriyah, Investigation of performance of Malaysian Islamic unit trust funds: Comparison with conventional unit trust funds, Managerial Finance, 33, 2, pp. 142-153, (2007); Ahmed, Shamima, Artificial intelligence and machine learning in finance: A bibliometric review, Research in International Business and Finance, 61, (2022); Al Janabi, Mazin A.M., Optimization algorithms and investment portfolio analytics with machine learning techniques under time-varying liquidity constraints, Journal of Modelling in Management, 17, 3, pp. 864-895, (2022); Al Rahahleh, Naseem M., Empirical comparison of Shariah-compliant vs conventional mutual fund performance, International Journal of Emerging Markets, 18, 10, pp. 4504-4523, (2023); Al-Natour, Sameh, A comparative assessment of sentiment analysis and star ratings for consumer reviews, International Journal of Information Management, 54, (2020); Alaminos, David, Hybrid genetic algorithms in agent-based artificial market model for simulating fan tokens trading, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 131, (2024); Amirzadeh, Rasoul, Applying Artificial Intelligence in Cryptocurrency Markets: A Survey, Algorithms, 15, 11, (2022); Artiga González, Tanja, Crowding of international mutual funds, Journal of Banking and Finance, 164, (2024); Bengtsson, Mariette, How to plan and perform a qualitative study using content analysis, NursingPlus Open, 2, pp. 8-14, (2016); Bertsimas, Dimitris J., From predictive to prescriptive analytics, Management Science, 66, 3, pp. 1025-1044, (2020)","","Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","","","","","","2590423X; 28113799","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012155134"

However, traditional process mining techniques frequently neglect the detection of significant low-frequency abnormalities due to their dependence on frequency and the inadequate incorporation of domain-specific knowledge. Therefore, we develop an enhanced process mining algorithm by incorporating a domain-specific follow-relationship matrix derived from standard operating procedures (SOPs). We empirically evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm based on real-world event logs from a corporate account-opening process conducted from January to December 2022 in a Chinese commercial bank. Additionally, we employed large language models (LLMs) for root cause analysis and process optimization recommendations. The empirical results demonstrate that the E-Heuristic Miner significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods and process mining algorithms in process anomaly detection. Furthermore, the integration of LLMs provides promising capabilities in semantic reasoning and offers explainable optimization suggestions, enhancing decision-making support in complex financial scenarios. Our study significantly improves the precision of process anomaly detection in financial contexts by incorporating banking-specific domain knowledge into process mining algorithms. Meanwhile, it extends theoretical boundaries and the practical applicability of process mining in intelligent, semantic-aware financial service management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anomaly Detection; Business Process Management; Commercial Banking; Domain Knowledge; Large Language Models; Process Mining; Administrative Data Processing; Banking; Decision Making; Domain Knowledge; Enterprise Resource Management; Heuristic Algorithms; Heuristic Methods; Knowledge Management; Learning Algorithms; Learning Systems; Machine Learning; Semantics; Anomaly Detection; Business Process; Business Process Management; Commercial Banking; Domain Knowledge; Language Model; Large Language Model; Mining Algorithms; Process Management; Process Mining","Administrative data processing; Banking; Decision making; Domain Knowledge; Enterprise resource management; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Knowledge management; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Semantics; Anomaly detection; Business Process; Business process management; Commercial banking; Domain knowledge; Language model; Large language model; Mining algorithms; Process management; Process mining","","","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (special project \u201CModeling and Optimization of Financial Service Based on Data and Behavior,\u201D grant number 72342024; \u201CTechnology Finance: Theories and Empirical Evidence,\u201D grant number 72495150; \u201CBounded Rationality of Financial Consumers, Misconduct of Financial Institutions and Suboptimal Financial Consumption Decisions,\u201D grant number 72071102) and National Social Science Foundation of China (special project \u201CResearch on the Innovative Path of Social Credit System in the Modernization of Social Governance,\u201D grant number 23&ZD175).","Gomber, Peter, On the Fintech Revolution: Interpreting the Forces of Innovation, Disruption, and Transformation in Financial Services, Journal of Management Information Systems, 35, 1, pp. 220-265, (2018); Chajakis, Emmanuel D., Operations in financial services - An overview, Production and Operations Management, 19, 6, pp. 633-664, (2010); Cheng, Xuanmei, Internal business process governance and external regulation: How does AI technology empower financial performance?, International Review of Financial Analysis, 99, (2025); Kim, Youngsoo, Operational Risk Management: Optimal Inspection Policy, Management Science, 70, 6, pp. 4087-4104, (2024); Adams, Nigel, Five guidelines to improve context-aware process selection: an Australian banking perspective, Business Process Management Journal, 31, 3, pp. 878-903, (2025); Oberle, Laura Johanna, How to build responsive service processes in German banks: the role of process documentation and the myth of automation, Business Process Management Journal, 29, 2, pp. 578-596, (2023); Xu, Yuqian, Operational Risk in Financial Services: A Review and New Research Opportunities, Production and Operations Management, 26, 3, pp. 426-445, (2017); J Manag Sci China, (2017); de Weerdt, Jochen, Process Mining for the multi-faceted analysis of business processes - A case study in a financial services organization, Computers in Industry, 64, 1, pp. 57-67, (2013); Taşkesenlioglu, Sedat, Identifying Possible Improvements of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Process of a Bank by Using Process Mining, International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering, 32, 4, pp. 525-552, (2022)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20798954","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011751460"

Drawing on the Resource-Based View and Contingency Theory, the study investigates whether accurate financial data reporting (AFDR) functions as a mechanism through which ISQMA contributes to sustainability outcomes, and whether the presence of AI and GCG strengthens these associations. Empirical data were collected from 257 accounting and finance professionals working in Jordanian commercial banks, providing a robust setting where digital infrastructure and sustainability imperatives converge. The results reveal that ISQMA is positively associated with both AFDR and CS, with AFDR partially mediating this relationship. Moreover, AI and GCG were found to strengthen the relationships between ISQMA and AFDR, and between ISQMA and CS, respectively.

Leveraging an equally weighted panel dataset and guided by robust empirical literature, we integrate structural econometric modeling—i.e., the stochastic frontier approach (SFA) to measuring the Lerner index of market power—with current best-practice tree-based ML algorithms (CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest) to predict non-performing loans (NPLs). The results show that bank-level financial performance measures, particularly loan ratio, profitability, and market power, outperform macroeconomic factors in forecasting credit risk. Among the models tested, CatBoost was more accurate and explainable, as confirmed by SHAP-based explainability analysis.

This research study explores a decentralized anomaly detection framework using deep autoencoders, designed to meet the dual imperatives of fraud detection effectiveness and user data privacy. Instead of relying on centralized aggregation or data sharing, the proposed model simulates distributed training across multiple financial nodes, with each institution processing data locally and independently. The framework is evaluated using two real-world datasets, the Credit Card Fraud dataset and the NeurIPS 2022 Bank Account Fraud dataset. The research methodology applied robust preprocessing, the implementation of a compact autoencoder architecture, and a threshold-based anomaly detection strategy. Evaluation metrics, such as confusion matrices, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, precision–recall (PR) curves, and reconstruction error distributions, are used to assess the model’s performance. Also, a threshold sensitivity analysis has been applied to explore detection trade-offs at varying levels of strictness. Although the model’s recall remains modest due to class imbalance, it demonstrates strong precision at higher thresholds, which demonstrates its utility in minimizing false positives. Overall, this research study is a practical and privacy-conscious approach to fraud detection that aligns with the operational realities of financial institutions and regulatory compliance toward scalability, privacy preservation, and interpretable fraud detection solutions suitable for real-world financial environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anomaly Detection; Decentralized Learning; Deep Autoencoder; Financial Cybercrime; Financial Security; Fraud Detection; Machine Learning","","","","","Proceedings, (2020); Caruana, Rich A., An empirical comparison of supervised learning algorithms, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, 148, pp. 161-168, (2006); Chen, Tianqi, XGBoost: A scalable tree boosting system, 13-17-August-2016, pp. 785-794, (2016); Ali, Ahmed H., An enhanced AI-based model for financial fraud detection, International Journal of Advanced and Applied Sciences, 11, 10, pp. 114-121, (2024); Mondal, Istiak Ahmed, Handling Imbalanced Data for Credit Card Fraud Detection, (2021); Bradley, Andrew P., The use of the area under the ROC curve in the evaluation of machine learning algorithms, Pattern Recognition, 30, 7, pp. 1145-1159, (1997); Jiang, Shanshan, Credit Card Fraud Detection Based on Unsupervised Attentional Anomaly Detection Network, Systems, 11, 6, (2023); Shetty, Vikas R., Safeguarding against Cyber Threats: Machine Learning-Based Approaches for Real-Time Fraud Detection and Prevention †, Engineering Proceedings, 59, 1, (2023); Yin, Chunyong, Anomaly Detection Based on Convolutional Recurrent Autoencoder for IoT Time Series, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, 52, 1, pp. 112-122, (2022); Aljunaid, Saif Khalifa, Secure and Transparent Banking: Explainable AI-Driven Federated Learning Model for Financial Fraud Detection, Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 18, 4, (2025)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","22277390","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010304811"

It delves into the methodologies employed, examining the effectiveness of ML techniques in predicting financial instability within the banking sector. In this study, the Gaussian Process Algorithm (GPC) model is used, along with three different optimizers: the Victoria Amazonica Optimizer (VAO), the African Vulture Optimizer (AVO), and the Dandelion Optimization Algorithm (DOA). The improvement in prediction accuracy is achieved by combining the GPC model with each of the three optimizers. The results show significant differences in the performance of the combined models. The GPAV model presents the best performance with an accuracy of 97.19% for the B target. This result highlights the outstanding predictive powers of AVO, showing that it is capable of predicting whether a bank is going to fail accordingly. The other models, GPDO and GPAV, present excellent accuracy rates of 96.26% and 95.32%, respectively, under the same conditions. These findings bring out the great potential of both the VAO and DOA in making accurate predictions of bank financial health. On the other hand, the worst performance among the investigated setups is that of the GPC model, which gives an accuracy of just 74.76% under identical conditions. This emphasizes the importance of using sophisticated optimization methods to enhance the prediction value of the GPC model in predicting probable bank failures. The work concludes by emphasizing the importance of ML, especially the integration of the GPC model with various optimizers, in predicting bank insolvency. The findings highlight the unique capabilities of various optimization algorithms and the need to select the right mix to achieve optimal forecast accuracy when analyzing banks’ financial health. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","African Vulture Optimizer; Banking; Dandelion Optimization Algorithm; Economy; Gaussian Process Algorithm; Victoria Amazonica Optimizer; Economics; Forecasting; Gaussian Distribution; Learning Algorithms; Learning Systems; Machine Learning; Optimization; African Vulture Optimizer; Algorithm Model; Dandelion Optimization Algorithm; Gaussian Process Algorithm; Gaussian Processes; Optimization Algorithms; Optimizers; Process Algorithms; Victoria Amazonicum Optimizer; Banking","Economics; Forecasting; Gaussian distribution; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Optimization; African vulture optimizer; Algorithm model; Dandelion optimization algorithm; Gaussian process algorithm; Gaussian Processes; Optimization algorithms; Optimizers; Process algorithms; Victoria amazonicum optimizer; Banking","","","This work was supported by the Educational Research Project of Hubei Higher Education Society, 2023 (Yuehua Bai).","Abdollahzadeh, Benyamin, African vultures optimization algorithm: A new nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm for global optimization problems, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 158, (2021); Ahmed, Ali Najah, Machine learning methods for better water quality prediction, Journal of Hydrology, 578, (2019); Ainan, Ummey Hany, Advancing Bankruptcy Forecasting With Hybrid Machine Learning Techniques: Insights From an Unbalanced Polish Dataset, IEEE Access, 12, pp. 9369-9381, (2024); Antulov-Fantulin, Nino, Predicting bankruptcy of local government: A machine learning approach, Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, 183, pp. 681-699, (2021); Barboza, Flavio Luiz De Moraes, Machine learning models and bankruptcy prediction, Expert Systems with Applications, 83, pp. 405-417, (2017); Barboza, Flavio Luiz De Moraes, New metrics and approaches for predicting bankruptcy, Communications in Statistics Part B: Simulation and Computation, 52, 6, pp. 2615-2632, (2023); Durica, Marek, Decision tree based model of business failure prediction for Polish companies, Oeconomia Copernicana, 10, 3, pp. 453-469, (2019); Radwan, Neyara, An Intelligent Approach for Predicting Bankruptcy Empowered with Machine Learning Technique, (2022); García Jiménez, Vicente, Dissimilarity-Based Linear Models for Corporate Bankruptcy Prediction, Computational Economics, 53, 3, pp. 1019-1031, (2019); Gholampoor, Hadi, Risk Analysis of Bankruptcy in the U.S. Healthcare Industries Based on Financial Ratios: A Machine Learning Analysis, Journal of Theoretical and Applied Electronic Commerce Research, 19, 2, pp. 1303-1320, (2024)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","18685145; 18685137","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008241245"

However, limited research has been conducted on factors influencing customers’ intention to switch from traditional to artificial intelligence (AI) based banking services. Therefore, the present study explored the key antecedents of the aforementioned intention. Methods: This two-stage study was based on the push–pull–mooring model. In Stage 1, in-depth semistructured interviews were conducted with stakeholders related to AI-based banking services to identify critical factors influencing customers’ intention to switch from traditional to AI-based customer services. In Stage 2, the results obtained in Stage 1 were combined with results from the literature to create a second-order model and direct-effect model (Models 1 and 2, respectively). Quantitative survey data were then collected to validate these models. Results: Model 1 indicated that among pull, push, and mooring factors, pull factors had the strongest effect on the aforementioned intention, followed by mooring factors and then push factors. The explanatory power (R2) of this model was 70 %. Furthermore, Model 2 indicated that the attractiveness of the alternative (a pull factor) and the need for interpersonal interaction and inertia (mooring factors) were the key factors influencing switching intention. The explanatory power (R2) of this model was 76 %. Conclusion: In summary, this study identified and validated critical factors affecting customers’ intention to switch to AI-based banking services. The findings enrich the understanding the social interaction and user behavior of AI, offering valuable insights for promoting AI-driven services and applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking; Customer Service; Generative Artificial Intelligence (genai); Push–pull–mooring (ppm) Model; Switching Intention; Banking; Economic And Social Effects; Sales; Banking Services; Critical Factors; Customer Intentions; Customer-service; Explanatory Power; Generative Artificial Intelligence; Push Pull; Push–pull–mooring Model; Switching Intentions; Two-stage Methods; Adult; Article; Artificial Intelligence; Consumer; Generative Artificial Intelligence; Human; Semi Structured Interview; Social Interaction","Banking; Economic and social effects; Sales; Banking services; Critical factors; Customer intentions; Customer-service; Explanatory power; Generative artificial intelligence; Push pull; Push–pull–mooring model; Switching intentions; Two-stage methods; adult; article; artificial intelligence; consumer; generative artificial intelligence; human; semi structured interview; social interaction","","","Funding text 1: This work was partial supported by National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan [MOST 109-2410-H-025 -016 -MY2] and [NSTC 113-2410-H-025-030 -].; Funding text 2: This work was partial supported by Ministry of Science and Technology of Republic of China, Taiwan [MOST 109-2410-H-025 -016 -MY2].","Abdulquadri, Abdulazeez Olamide, Digital transformation in financial services provision: a Nigerian perspective to the adoption of chatbot, Journal of Enterprising Communities, 15, 2, pp. 258-281, (2021); Anton Martin, Carmen, The mediating effect of satisfaction on consumers' switching intention, Psychology and Marketing, 24, 6, pp. 511-538, (2007); Ashfaq, Muhammad, I, Chatbot: Modeling the determinants of users’ satisfaction and continuance intention of AI-powered service agents, Telematics and Informatics, 54, (2020); Bansal, Harvir S., Migrating"" to new service providers: Toward a unifying framework of consumers' switching behaviors, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 33, 1, pp. 96-115, (2005); Becker, Jan Michael, Hierarchical Latent Variable Models in PLS-SEM: Guidelines for Using Reflective-Formative Type Models, Long Range Planning, 45, 5-6, pp. 359-394, (2012); Berry, Leonard L., Understanding service convenience, Journal of Marketing, 66, 3, pp. 1-17, (2002); Calvo-Porral, Cristina, Satisfaction and switching intention in mobile services: Comparing lock-in and free contracts in the Spanish market, Telematics and Informatics, 34, 5, pp. 717-729, (2017); Cao, Junwei, Toward street vending in post COVID-19 China: Social networking services information overload and switching intention, Technology in Society, 66, (2021); Chang, Hsinhsin, Applying push-pull-mooring to investigate channel switching behaviors: M-shopping self-efficacy and switching costs as moderators, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 24, pp. 50-67, (2017); Chen, Yuhsin, Utilizing the Push-Pull-Mooring-Habit framework to explore users’ intention to switch from offline to online real-person English learning platform, Internet Research, 29, 1, pp. 167-193, (2019)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","07475632","","CHBEE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000803385"

In the realm of mortgage products, there has been a significant emphasis on the environmental aspect of environmental, social, and governance considerations. One area where we can act in this way is the property market. Here, energy performance certificates (EPCs), which determine the energy class of a building, play an important role, especially from the point of view of banks. Banks see the contribution of EPCs as an added value in assessing the riskiness of a building, which has a major impact when we talk about lending, investments, and other banking aspects. In our research, we tested twenty-eight different models, looking for the one that would classify buildings into energy classes as accurately as possible.

Scant corporate disclosure on water demand and operational intensity necessitates the use of advanced data science tools to inform risk exposures and investment decisions. Using 2550 company years across eleven industry sectors, machine learning models were built from financial data to quantify corporate water intensity metrics. These metrics were benchmarked to revenue, operating profit and investment in fixed assets. Fixed asset turnover, financial leverage, and inventory turnover were key predictors in factor models, particularly for production-oriented sectors such as IT, or consumer staples with R2 values from 0.66 to 0.75. Comparison of predicted water intensity data to disclosed information using global and industry-specific models indicated statistical agreement for selected sectors.

The aim of this study is to identify the technology convergence (TC) and innovation trends utilizing both text and data mining techniques on patent data within the FinTech domain. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 36,335 patents in FinTech were retrieved for analysis from the Lens database. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers topic modelling was performed on the Abstract and Claims Text Dataset. Association rule mining (ARM) was performed on 204 distinct Cooperative PClassification (CPC) codes among the retrieved patent data. The interestingness measures calculated were confidence, Kulczynski and imbalance ratio (IR). Findings: Top five topics obtained revealed the convergence of Fintech into blockchain, advertising, information processing, logistics and geolocation-based payment. Findings also highlighted the organizations such as Bank of America, Capital One, IBM, Amazon and Mastercard being the key players in the topics obtained. ARM revealed 405 association rules across 31 distinct CPC codes, revealing convergence across data and image processing, along with machine learning, biometrics and a significant number of patents in energy management systems and renewable energy. Practical implications: BERT topic modelling, combined with ARM’s interestingness measures, provides financial organizations with a detailed map of structured insights into the strength and direction of technological intersections.

It is necessary to respond to these market- and technology-driven changes appropriately. Innovative approaches are needed to overcome the limitations of traditional methods. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are suitable for dealing with the various risk types banks face. Academic literature focuses on applying ML in credit risk management. This article addresses market, operational, liquidity, and other risk types, with the objective to examine how ML algorithms predict, assess, and mitigate these risks and identify both their advantages and challenges. This article systematically reviews 46 recent studies and highlights the expanding role of ML in enhancing risk management strategies. The article has revealed that ML is adequately covered in the context of market and operational risk. The learning ability and predictive capabilities of artificial neural networks and other algorithms are promising for risk management. Our findings offer a concise overview of current ML applications for multiple risk types in banking, identifying research gaps, highlighting opportunities and challenges and providing actionable directions for further studies.

Nowcasting offers a viable solution to the common challenges in forecasting, like delayed access to macroeconomic data, uneven timing of official data releases, structural shifts in the data generating process, and mismeasurement due to data gaps and revisions. The strength of nowcasts lies in their ability to update themselves based on the new information arriving regularly. However, a trade-off exists between the frequency of data arrival and the stability of nowcasts. This study examines the extant literature using a Structured Literature Review, with a special focus on Economics and Finance. The study highlights the needs and challenges in nowcasting and conducts a bibliometric analysis to identify the clustering patterns in keywords pertaining to nowcasting literature and their evolution over time, indicating the direction in which nowcasting research is heading. The study then identifies various models used in the literature, classifying them into a few overarching categories. The study finds that the principal advantage of standard statistical nowcasting models lies in their ability to handle the data issues such as high dimensionality, unavailability/lagged availability, non-synchronicity, non-linearity and frequent revisions in data. However, these models may not be appropriate for big data which witness exponential rise in hyperparameters. Machine learning models provide a complementing tool because they deal with big data and enable better cross-validation for efficient hyperparameter selection. Finally, this study undertakes an empirical exercise wherein Factor Augmented Mixed Data Sampling Model has been utilised to nowcast the United Kingdom’s inflation using high frequency indicators from December, 2021 to March, 2024—a period of turbulence when the country witnessed the worst bout of inflation.

The rooftop PV may diminish the system's energy efficiency by lowering the power factor (PF) on the grid side. The current work provides a machine learning approach that estimates the necessary capacitor banks to boost the PF to unity, enabling proactive remedial action for energy savings. Various machine learning models, such as linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, random forest, decision tree, XGBoost, Adaboost, and gradient boosting, are evaluated to improve the system's efficiency. The best model is Lasso Regression, which produces a high R2 score of 0.89 with low MSE and MAPE values. The model is based on real-time data collected from a 100 kWp PV plant connected to an 11 kV grid supply and an institutional building load. The model undergoes validation by implementing the forecasted capacitor banks. According to the findings, a 10.60 kVAR-rated shunt capacitor is required to maintain the PF at unity and save an average of 1673.52 kWh of energy per month. This work highlights the necessity of implementing Lasso regression in energy management systems to improve PF, decrease electricity costs, and reduce environmental impacts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Capacitor Bank; Grid-connected Pv Systems; Machine Learning; Power Factor; Predictive Modeling; Capacitor Bank; Energy; Grid Connected Pv System; Improving Efficiency; Lasso Regressions; Machine Learning Approaches; Machine-learning; Power Factors; Predictive Models; Pv Plants","Capacitor bank; Energy; Grid connected PV system; Improving efficiency; Lasso regressions; Machine learning approaches; Machine-learning; Power factors; Predictive models; PV plants","","","This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (2020R1A2C1004743).","AlShafeey, Mutaz, Evaluating neural network and linear regression photovoltaic power forecasting models based on different input methods, Energy Reports, 7, pp. 7601-7614, (2021); Alsharif, Mohammed H., Comparative analysis of solar-powered base stations for green mobile networks, Energies, 10, 8, (2017); Alsharif, Mohammed H., Unleashing the potential of sixth generation (6G) wireless networks in smart energy grid management: A comprehensive review, Energy Reports, 11, pp. 1376-1398, (2024); Alsharif, Mohammed H., Long-Term Techno-Economic Analysis of Sustainable and Zero Grid Cellular Base Station, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 54159-54172, (2021); Alsharif, Mohammed H., Green wireless network optimisation strategies within smart grid environments for Long Term Evolution (LTE) cellular networks in Malaysia, Renewable Energy, 85, pp. 157-170, (2016); Jobayer, Md, A systematic review on predicting PV system parameters using machine learning, Heliyon, 9, 6, (2023); Shaheer Ansari, Shaheer, A review of monitoring technologies for solar pv systems using data processing modules and transmission protocols: Progress, challenges and prospects, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 15, (2021); Benti, Natei Ermias, Forecasting Renewable Energy Generation with Machine Learning and Deep Learning: Current Advances and Future Prospects, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 9, (2023); Carneiro, Tatiane Carolyne, Ridge regression ensemble of machine learning models applied to solar and wind forecasting in Brazil and Spain, Applied Energy, 314, (2022); Cattani, Gilles, Combining data envelopment analysis and Random Forest for selecting optimal locations of solar PV plants, Energy and AI, 11, (2023)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","23524847","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211158236"

Utilizing a comprehensive secondary dataset comprising macroeconomic and bank-specific indicators from 61 commercial banks across Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam (2010–2023), we systematically evaluate the predictive power of multiple machine learning models. A rigorous cross-validation framework is employed to optimize forecasting accuracy, integrating Linear Regression, Random Forest, K-Neighbors, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, Support Vector Regression, and XGBoost with Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net regularization. Empirical results reveal that key drivers of financial stability include equity capital, financial leverage, return on equity, GDP growth, inflation, technological advancements, and systemic shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, the Ridge-optimized XGBRegressor model achieves the highest predictive accuracy (~89%), demonstrating the efficacy of hybrid machine learning approaches in financial stability forecasting.

Some advocate for diversification, while others argue that its importance should not be overstated. Some financial institutions are encouraged to focus on their traditional investments instead of income diversification, while others suggest that income diversification can stabilize or destabilize, depending on the regulatory environment. These conflicting results indicate a lack of clear evidence regarding the effectiveness of income diversification. Therefore, this paper aims to study the impact of income diversification on bank stability and enhance the predictive performance of bank stability by analyzing the period from 2000 to 2021 using a sample from 26 European countries, based on aggregate bank data. It employs a hybrid method that combines econometric techniques, specifically the generalized method of moments and a fixed-effects model, with machine-learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machine. These methods are applied to enhance the reliability and predictive power of the analysis by addressing the problem of endogeneity (via generalized method of moments) and capturing non-linearities, interactions, and high-dimensional patterns (via machine learning). The econometric findings reveal that income diversification can reduce non-performing loans, improve bank solvency, and enhance the Z-score, indicating the significant role of income diversification in improving bank stability. Conversely, the results also show that the machine-learning algorithms used play a crucial role in enhancing the predictive performance of bank stability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank Stability; Financial Supervision; Income Diversification; Random Forest; Support Vector Machines","","","","","Ben Lahouel, Bechir, Nonlinearities between bank stability and income diversification: A dynamic network data envelopment analysis approach, Expert Systems with Applications, 207, (2022); Velasco, Pilar, Is bank diversification a linking channel between regulatory capital and bank value?, British Accounting Review, 54, 4, (2022); Proceedings of the 5th Eba Policy Research Workshop Competition in Banking Implications for Financial Regulation and Supervision; Sharma, Shweta, Income diversification and bank performance: evidence from BRICS nations, International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management, 67, 9, pp. 1625-1639, (2018); Dzingirai, Canicio, Threshold effect of non-interest income disaggregates on commercial banks’ financial performance in Zimbabwe, Heliyon, 10, 10, (2024); Nisar, Shoaib, The impact of revenue diversification on bank profitability and stability: Empirical evidence from south asian countries, International Journal of Financial Studies, 6, 2, (2018); Kim, Hakkon, Financial crisis, bank diversification, and financial stability: OECD countries, International Review of Economics and Finance, 65, pp. 94-104, (2020); Zouaoui, Haykel, What do we know about the impact of income diversification on bank performance?

This study uses experimental testing and machine learning regression analysis to explore the heat release rate (HRR) characteristics and influencing factors of box-type power banks under fire conditions. A 1 MW calorimeter was used to conduct four sets of experiments involving a total of 15 box-type power banks, measuring the HRR and analyzing its correlation with oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide generation, smoke temperature, and the fire growth rate. Based on the experimental data, HRR prediction models were constructed using decision tree regression (DT), K-nearest neighbor regression (KNN), and linear regression (LR). The results indicate that the DT model performs best in HRR prediction (MAE = 0.4889, MSE = 0.7414, RMSE = 0.8571, R2 = 0.9991), effectively capturing the nonlinear variation patterns in the HRR. The correlation analysis and regression analysis conducted in this study provide crucial data support for fire combustion characteristics research, fire risk assessment, and fire safety optimization. Furthermore, the findings provide crucial data support for research on fire combustion characteristics and data-driven fire risk assessment, which may serve as a foundation for future AI-based real-time fire detection applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Box-type Power Bank; Correlation Analysis; Heat Release Rate; Regression Analysis; Transportation Safety","","","","This research was supported by the Key Research and Development Program Projects of China Railway Science and Technology Co., Ltd.

While most banks have rapidly transitioned from traditional data analysis methods to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) for daily transaction analysis, the impact of AI on sustainable innovation performance and organizational learning remains underexplored. This study, grounded in dynamic capabilities theory, investigates the mediating role of organizational learning in the relationship between AI adoption in the banking sector and sustainable innovation performance. Data were collected from 401 employees across Libya’s conventional and Islamic banking sectors using a judgmental sampling technique. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS–SEM) was used to analyze the data and assess the relationships among the variables. The findings indicate that AI adoption significantly and positively influences sustainable innovation performance and organizational learning. Additionally, organizational learning was found to have a significant positive effect on sustainable innovation performance and to partially mediate the relationship between AI adoption and innovation performance.

However, the factors driving IVA adoption and usage, particularly in specific regional contexts such as Portugal, remain underexplored. This study examined the determinants of IVA adoption intention and actual usage in the Portuguese banking sector, drawing on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as its theoretical foundation. Data were collected through an online questionnaire distributed to 154 banking customers after they interacted with a commercial bank’s IVA. The analysis was conducted using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings revealed that perceived usefulness significantly influences the intention to adopt, which in turn significantly impacts actual usage. In contrast, other variables—including trust, ease of use, anthropomorphism, awareness, service quality, and gendered voice—did not show a significant effect. These results suggest that Portuguese users adopt IVAs based primarily on functional utility, highlighting the importance of outcome-oriented design and communication strategies.

The dataset includes Altman Z-Scores and Corporate Governance Compliance (CGC) indicators calculated for manufacturing firms listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange (BSE) from 2016 to 2022. Leveraging Signaling Theory, the study analyzes financial and governance data for 60 non-financial firms, comprising 420 firm-year observations. Financial distress is classified into three categories: no distress, moderate distress, and severe distress. The study employs a Random Forest classification model, leveraging artificial intelligence techniques to identify critical predictive variables and evaluate their combined effectiveness in signaling financial distress. The findings reveal that machine learning algorithms significantly improve the predictive accuracy and reliability of financial distress classifications, effectively distinguishing between different distress levels by integrating financial ratios and corporate governance variables. These results emphasize the advantages of involving artificial intelligence and advanced analytics in financial distress prediction models, enhancing transparency and strengthening investor confidence.

Investors continuously seek methods to predict market patterns and minimize losses despite the inherent volatility of stock prices. Predicting stock prices using machine learning and artificial intelligence is one promising approach. While stock market fluctuations are inevitable, leveraging AI to make informed forecasts is both feasible and recommended. With the advancement of machine learning, various algorithms have been developed to forecast stock prices. This study introduces the Battle Royal Optimizer and Extreme Learning Machine model to predict stock prices. The dataset spans from January 2, 2015, to June 29, 2023, collected from the Hong Kong stock market. Our findings suggest that the proposed model offers a valuable approach to analyzing and forecasting stock time series data. When compared to alternative models, it demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and goodness of fit.

For credit risk management, digital transformation brings greater clarity to the risk profiles. Typically, datasets include various features, and many of them may be irrelevant. Removing relevant features and keeping irrelevant ones in the dataset may be harmful and lead to ruining the decision-making process. In this paper, we investigate the interesting decision variables that can be used to create a credit risk prediction model. This model will help the bank staff evaluate the loan applications of customers and classify the loan applicants as “defaulter” and “non-defaulter” customers. In addition, the loan applicants can decide on the loan acceptance status online without physical visits to the bank. In this work, we build a machine learning model by using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm based on the Australian and Taiwan banking dataset. Besides, we deploy the SMOTE technique to balance the data and overcome the suboptimal results. For statistical calculations, we use the R computing environment. The results show that demographic, financial, economic, and ‘behavioral indicators have significant effects on credit risk and the efficiency of the proposed model, with an average accuracy of 89.543% for the Australian dataset and 88.345% for the Taiwan dataset. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking; Credit Risk; Machine Learning Model; Neural Network; Adversarial Machine Learning; Bank Credit Risks; Banking Sectors; Credit Risk Management; Credit Risks; Digital Transformation; Machine Learning Models; Neural-networks; Relevant Features; Risk Predictions; Risk Profile","Adversarial machine learning; Bank credit risks; Banking sectors; Credit risk management; Credit risks; Digital transformation; Machine learning models; Neural-networks; Relevant features; Risk predictions; Risk profile","","","","Lin, Shunzhi, How organizations leverage digital technology to develop customization and enhance customer relationship performance: An empirical investigation, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 188, (2023); Martínez-Peláez, Rafael, Role of Digital Transformation for Achieving Sustainability: Mediated Role of Stakeholders, Key Capabilities, and Technology, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 14, (2023); Ozili, Peterson K., Financial stability and sustainable development, International Journal of Finance and Economics, 29, 3, pp. 2620-2646, (2024); Karim, Sitara, Sustainable banking regulations pre and during coronavirus outbreak: the moderating role of financial stability, Economic Research-Ekonomska Istrazivanja, 35, 1, pp. 3360-3377, (2022); Buehler, Kevin, The new arsenal of risk management, Harvard Business Review, 86, 9, pp. 92-137, (2008); Naili, Maryem, The determinants of banks' credit risk: Review of the literature and future research agenda, International Journal of Finance and Economics, 27, 1, pp. 334-360, (2022); Resmilitaris, (2022); Bouteillé, Sylvain, The Handbook of Credit Risk Management: Originating, Assessing, and Managing Credit Exposures, pp. 1-332, (2015); Financial Times, (2005); Moodys Analytics Risk Perspectives, (2017)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","14333058; 09410643","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000437862"

The research investigates how certain brand identity elements (e.g. words, colours, visual elements, symbols) in retail banks' Twitter posts trigger consumer reactions (likes). Findings: – We found that although some factors statistically significantly increase the popularity of a post, there is no well-identified, general brand identity element that has a commercially relevant impact on consumer responses, i.e., the popularity of a post.

It examines whether individuals with stronger maximizing tendencies are more likely to perceive algorithms as effective, thereby reducing their algorithm aversion, and ultimately increasing the likelihood of using AI advisors in their financial decision-making. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative pre-study amongst individuals differing in their maximizing tendencies to learn more about the existing usage patterns of AI advisors for financial decisions was combined with a quantitative study to experimentally test our hypotheses. For both studies, US participants were recruited through Prolific. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis in NVivo and regression analysis in the SPSS Process macro. Findings: The results show that individuals primed with a maximizing mindset demonstrated a higher likelihood of using AI advisors for their financial decisions. This effect was serially mediated by the perception of enhanced algorithm effectiveness and reduced algorithm aversion. Practical implications: This study provides actionable insights for financial service providers such as banks, pension funds and insurance companies into strategies on how to reduce algorithm aversion and encourage greater AI usage in decision-making amongst their (potential) clients. In particular, to increase the likelihood that consumers will rely on AI advisors for financial decisions, financial service providers can induce a maximizing mindset in these individuals by adjusting the wording of their marketing communications material. Originality/value: This study extends our understanding of how maximizing tendencies influence the likelihood of using AI advisors. It contributes to the literature by highlighting the role of perceived effectiveness and algorithm aversion and by demonstrating that experimentally inducing a maximizing mindset can increase AI usage for financial decisions; doing so is important as AI can help provide consumers with personalized advice in a cost-effective way. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Algorithm Aversion; Artificial Intelligence; Financial Advice; Maximizing; Perceived Effectiveness","","","","","Acikgoz, Fulya, Consumer engagement with AI-powered voice assistants: A behavioral reasoning perspective, Psychology and Marketing, 40, 11, pp. 2226-2243, (2023); Ameen, Nisreen A., Generation Z's psychology and new-age technologies: Implications for future research, Psychology and Marketing, 40, 10, pp. 2029-2040, (2023); Araujo, Theo B., In AI we trust?

This study adopted a descriptive survey design. Data was collected with a self-designed questionnaire. Fifty-two employees from five selected banks in Nairobi, participated in the study. The findings revealed that banks utilize AI in various aspects of operational and customer services but highly in cybersecurity, fraud detection, and anticipating customer needs. The findings also revealed that 82.7% of the respondents perceived that the high utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in the banking industry raises the fear of job loss as they considered consolidation of tasks for a few workers and reduced staff workforce as the threats associated to Artificial Intelligence (AI) utilization in the banking industry. The employees believe that their jobs could be secured by embracing the AI technology and skill improvement. Thus, the study recommends that bank authorities facilitate the adjustments of the bank employees as jobs are redesigned to enable their transition to AI-related positions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Bank Employees; Banking Industry; Job Loss; Job Security; Utilization","","","","","Abubakar, A.

This study investigates how edge computing infrastructures influence decision-making accuracy, responsiveness, and risk containment in economic systems, particularly under the threat of financial contagion. A synthetic dataset simulating the interaction between economic indicators and edge performance metrics was constructed to emulate real-time decision environments. Composite indicators were developed to quantify key dynamics, and a range of machine learning models, including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Neural Networks, were applied to classify economic decision outcomes. The results indicate that low latency, efficient resource use, and balanced workload distribution are significantly associated with higher decision quality. XGBoost outperformed all other models, achieving 97% accuracy and a ROC-AUC of 0.997. The findings suggest that edge computing performance metrics can act as predictive signals for systemic fragility and may be integrated into early warning systems for financial risk management.

The study simulates a partial registry, containing data from 450 villages across 10 impoverished districts of Malawi, and contains proxy poverty indicators. These indicators are used to impute estimates of household per capita consumption, which in turn are used to train a prediction model using publicly available geospatial data. This method is evaluated against an imputed reference of village welfare, derived from the 2016 household survey. The partial registry approach is benchmarked against three alternatives: proxy means test scores, the Meta Relative Wealth Index, and predictions from household surveys with geospatial indicators. Results show the partial registry model's rank correlation with actual welfare measures at 0.75, outperforming the other methods significantly, which ranged from -0.02 to 0.2. These findings hold under various robustness checks, including the addition of Gaussian noise, indicating that collecting household-level proxy poverty data in low-income areas can significantly improve the performance of machine learning models that integrate survey and satellite imagery data for village-level geographic targeting. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Geographic Targeting; Machine Learning; Poverty; Poverty Mapping; Satellite Data; Small Area Estimation; Estimation Method; Household Survey; Machine Learning; Mapping; Poverty; Satellite Data; Satellite Imagery; Spatial Data; Malawi","estimation method; household survey; machine learning; mapping; poverty; satellite data; satellite imagery; spatial data; Malawi","","","The authors thank Lina Cardona, German Caruso, Chipo Msowoya, and Boban Paul for their support in providing data, financing, and support for this project.

Investments in renewable hydrogen production, AI-driven smart grids, and carbon capture technologies have shown significant potential in accelerating the energy transition. For example, Japan's Fukushima Hydrogen Energy Research Field, the world's largest renewable hydrogen facility, uses solar power to produce hydrogen, supporting decarbonization in transport and industry. Additionally, Japan has pioneered the development of a hydrogen highway, a network of hydrogen fueling stations designed to support hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs) that was supported by the Japanese green finance scheme. With over 80 hydrogen refueling stations nationwide, Japan's initiative demonstrates how technological investments, supported by strong policy frameworks, can drive the adoption of clean energy solutions (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, 2024). While technological progress is key, financial incentives, regulatory support, and infrastructure development are essential for scaling clean energy solutions.

It reveals linkages across different market segments and their influence on spillovers between segments at different investment horizons. Design/methodology/approach: The research methodology involves using the TVP-VAR model. This model allows the authors to analyze return spillovers across different time frames by capturing the dynamic nature of the relationships between variables. The authors also consider various global factors in the regression analysis for rigor (Chatziantoniou et al., 2023). Findings: This research shows that short-term changes impact extreme risk interconnectedness more than medium- or long-term changes. Well-established market indices like AI-related stocks (MSFT, GOOG and NVDA) and Islamic banks (Saudi Arabia, UAE) consistently contribute to or transmit returns. In contrast, most AI-related tokens and Asian Islamic banks tend to receive shocks. Two indices related to gold and the uncertainty of the US dollar demonstrate potential for hedging and predictability in interconnectedness. Practical implications: The results emphasize the vital role of short-term changes in diversifying a portfolio and managing risks, providing valuable insights for financial analysts and professionals in AI-related finance, Islamic banking and portfolio management. Originality/value: The rising importance of AI-related stocks and tokens in investing has raised concerns about their compatibility with traditional financial instruments, especially in Islamic finance (Rabbani et al., 2023; Darehshiri et al., 2022; Yousaf et al., 2022).

The comprehensive solution offers an actionable framework for bank managers to mitigate CFs by prioritizing fraud detection, leveraging early warning signals (EWS), and implementing tailored, need-based control measures before, during, and after a fraud event. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a multi-method approach, beginning with an extensive literature review on fraud identification, assessment, and prevention strategies. A theoretical framework is constructed to support the proposed SG and BG measures. Machine learning-based data analysis, using Artificial Neural Networks, is employed to dynamically assess the severity of CFs in real time. A managerial action plan for each phase of the fraud lifecycle is presented. Findings: The research underscores the necessity for an adaptable, dual-layered response system that transitions from reactive to proactive and predictive mitigation strategies. The study introduces a novel approach incorporating SG and BG mitigation measures, enabling managers to detect early warning signals and implement robust post-fraud interventions. Practical implications: The dual-layer approach enhances the sector's resilience to CFs by providing a robust, adaptive framework for fraud prevention and mitigation.

Employing a largely qualitative approach, the study found that chatbots are a useful tool for customer service automation, with significant potential for providing good quality service. In general, sentiments towards chatbots were positive for simple tasks, with users and experts citing convenience, 24/7 availability, and speed as primary factors driving customer satisfaction levels. However, the limitations of chatbots in answer accuracy and reliability mean that they still require significant learning and development to be a sufficient solution for complex customer service problems. Chatbots are significantly limited in their capabilities and ability to parse customer queries. Therefore, they cannot be expected to handle all customer queries without some assistance from a human. On the other hand, chatbots have huge potential for learning, and artificial intelligence as a field presents a largely untapped universe of opportunity. This study thus highlights how chatbots are currently being used and how they are likely to be used in the future. Based on these findings, we develop an experimental framework that explains how to assess chatbots for dynamic customer service capabilities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Banking & Finance; Chatbots; Convenience; Customer Satisfaction; Dynamic Capabilities; Learning & Development; Value Creation; Banking; Customer Satisfaction; Quality Of Service; Banking & Finance; Banking And Finance; Chatbots; Convenience; Customer Queries; Customer-service; Customers' Satisfaction; Dynamics Capability; Learning & Development; Value Creation; Sales","Banking; Customer satisfaction; Quality of service; Banking & finance; Banking and finance; Chatbots; Convenience; Customer queries; Customer-service; Customers' satisfaction; Dynamics capability; Learning & development; Value creation; Sales","","","","Software Tricks People into Thinking It is Human, (2011); undefined, (2016); Braun, Virginia, Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, 2, pp. 77-101, (2006); undefined, (2014); undefined, (2017); Chui, Michael, What AI can and can't do (yet) for your business, McKinsey Quarterly, 2018, 1, pp. 96-108, (2018); undefined, (2014); Davenport, Thomas H., How artificial intelligence will change the future of marketing, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 48, 1, pp. 24-42, (2020); undefined, (2016); undefined, (2016)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","07475632","","CHBEE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216086653"

Previous research has predominantly focused on internal determinants of corporate financial resilience. However, it has paid limited attention to the role of external institutional factors. This gap is particularly evident in the context of data factor marketization (DFM). We addressed this gap by investigating the impact of DFM on corporate financial resilience, drawing on resource dependence theory (RDT) to highlight the importance of the external policy environment and inter-organizational resource exchange. We employed a double machine learning (DML) framework to assess corporate financial resilience using comprehensive panel data from Chinese listed firms. This approach overcomes the limitations of traditional econometric methods by allowing nonlinear interactions and high-dimensional controls. The results show that DFM significantly enhances corporate financial resilience, with its impact varying across different institutional contexts. Additionally, firm characteristics moderate this relationship. Specifically, ownership structure strengthens or weakens the positive effect of DFM, while industry competition and geographical location have varying effects on resilience outcomes. We offered novel theoretical insights and practical guidance for policymakers seeking to leverage institutional reforms to enhance financial resilience within an increasingly volatile and uncertain business landscape. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corporate Financial Resilience; Data Factor Marketization; Double Machine Learning; Institutional Environment; Resource Dependence; Banking; Fintech; Investments; Resource Allocation; Corporate Financial Resilience; Corporates; Data Factor Marketization; Digital Economy; Double Machine Learning; Institutional Environment; Institutional Reforms; Machine-learning; Organisational; Resource Dependences; Financial Markets","Banking; Fintech; Investments; Resource allocation; Corporate financial resilience; Corporates; Data factor marketization; Digital economy; Double machine learning; Institutional environment; Institutional reforms; Machine-learning; Organisational; Resource dependences; Financial markets","","","","Wang, Yewen, How does digital transformation affect corporate resilience: a moderation perspective study, Applied Economics, 57, 2, pp. 121-134, (2025); Huang, Yang, Can digital transformation promote the green innovation quality of enterprises?

Financial records always contain confidential information. Hence, privacy is significant in the BLP system. This research aims to generate a privacy-preserving automated BLP scheme. To achieve this, differential privacy (DP) is combined with machine learning (ML). Using a benchmark dataset, the proposed method analyzes two different DP techniques, namely Laplacian and Gaussian, with five different ML models: Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Logistic Regression (LR), and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost). Each of the DP techniques is evaluated by varying distinct privacy parameters with 10-fold cross-validation, and from the outcome analysis, optimal parameters are nominated to balance privacy and security. The analysis indicates that applying the Laplacian mechanism with a DP budget of 2 and the RF model achieves the highest accuracy of 62.31%. For the Gaussian method, the best accuracy of 81.25% is attained by the CatBoost model in privacy budget 1.5. Additionally, the proposed method uses explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to show the conclusion capability of DP-integrated ML models. The proposed research shows an efficient method for automated BLP while preserving the privacy of personal financial information and, thus, mitigating vulnerability to scams and fraud. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Differential Privacy (dp); Explainable Artificial Intelligence (xai); Machine Learning (ml); Privacy Budget (pb); Anonymity; Differential Privacy; Logistic Regression; Sensitive Data; Supervised Learning; Bank Loans; Differential Privacies; Explainable Artificial Intelligence (xai); Financial Records; Laplacians; Machine Learning; Machine-learning; Prediction Systems; Privacy Budget; Adaptive Boosting","Anonymity; Differential privacy; Logistic regression; Sensitive data; Supervised learning; Bank loans; Differential privacies; Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI); Financial records; Laplacians; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Prediction systems; Privacy budget; Adaptive boosting","","","","An Introduction to Statistical Learning, (2013); International Journal of Economics and Financial Issues, (2020); Retrieved from Bank of England, (2019); Statistical Tables Relating to Banks in India 202122web Publication Released by Rbi Retrieved from Current Affairs, (2022); Milojević, Nenad, Prospects of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Application in Banking Risk Management, Journal of Central Banking Theory and Practice, 10, 3, pp. 41-57, (2021); Identity Theft Resource Center S 2021 Annual Data Breach Report Sets New Record for Number of Compromises, (2022); Cost of A Data Breach the Healthcare Industry, (2024); Dwork, Cynthia, Calibrating noise to sensitivity in private data analysis, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3876 LNCS, pp. 265-284, (2006); Proceedings of the 7th North American International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management, (2022); International Journal of Engineering and Management Research, (2023)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20799292","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003670331"

Despite the promise of AI operations in identifying financial anomalies, unclear decision-making processes and algorithmic bias constrain its extensive acceptance, especially in regulation-driven banking sectors. This study uses a quantitative strategy based on Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and Multi-Group Analysis (MGA) of survey responses from 409 bank professionals, such as auditors and compliance officers. This study shows that transparency greatly enhances trust, which is the leading predictor of AI uptake. Fairness perception mediates the negative impacts of algorithmic bias, emphasizing its important role in establishing system credibility. The analysis of subgroups shows differential regional and professional variations in trust and fairness sensitivity, where internal auditors and highly AI-exposed subjects are found to exhibit higher adoption preparedness. Compliance with regulations also emerges as a positive enabler of adoption. This paper concludes with suggestions for practical implementation by banks, developers, and regulators to align AI deployment with ethical and regulatory aspirations. It recommends transparent, explainable, and fairness-sensitive AI tools as essential for promoting adoption in regulation-driven sectors. The findings provide a guide for promoting responsible, trust-driven AI implementation in fraud detection. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai Adoption; Ai Transparency; Algorithmic Bias; Explainability; Fairness Perception; Financial Institutions; Fraud Detection; Machine Learning; Regulatory Compliance; Trust","","","","","Abu Huson, Yazan, Cloud-based artificial intelligence and audit report: the mediating role of the auditor, VINE Journal of Information and Knowledge Management Systems, (2025); Finance Accounting Research Journal, (2024); Akhtar, Mohammad Amir Khusru, Towards Ethical and Socially Responsible Explainable AI: Challenges and Opportunities, Studies in Systems, Decision and Control, 551, pp. 1-381, (2024); Al-Abbadi, Lina Hamdan Mahmoud, BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE AND STRATEGIC ENTREPRENEURSHIP FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) THROUGH: (GREEN TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION AND GREEN KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT), ECONOMICS - Innovative and Economics Research Journal, 13, 1, pp. 45-68, (2025); Al-Dosari, Khalifa Youssef Mubarak, Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Defense System for Banking Industry: A Qualitative Study of AI Applications and Challenges, Cybernetics and Systems, 55, 2, pp. 302-330, (2024); Supply Chain Dynamism as A Moderator, (2024); Andrae, Silvio, Fairness and Bias in Machine Learning Models for Credit Decisions, pp. 1-24, (2025); Ashfaq, Muhammad, Knowledge, Attitude, and Perceptions of Financial Industry Employees Towards AI in the GCC Region, pp. 95-115, (2021); Collnet Journal of Scientometrics and Information Management, (2022); Barnes, Aaron J., AI and culture: Culturally dependent responses to AI systems, Current Opinion in Psychology, 58, (2024)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","19118074","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003462894"

Traditionally, churn models assess service quality using customer satisfaction metrics; however, these subjective variables often yield low predictive accuracy. This study examines the relationship between customer attrition and account balance using decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), and gradient-boosting machines (GBM). This research utilises a customer churn dataset and applies synthetic oversampling to balance class distribution during the preprocessing of financial variables. Account balance service is the primary factor in predicting customer churn, as it yields more accurate predictions compared to traditional subjective assessment methods. The tested model set achieved its highest predictive performance by applying boosting methods. The evaluation of research data highlights the critical role of financial indicators in shaping effective customer retention strategies.

Financial stability, customer trust, and compliance are increasingly threatened as centralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) models fail to adapt, leading to inefficiencies, false positives, and undetected detection. These limitations necessitate advanced AI solutions for banks to adapt properly to emerging fraud patterns. While AI enhances fraud detection, its black-box nature limits transparency, making it difficult for analysts to trust, validate, and refine decisions, posing challenges for compliance, fraud explanation, and adversarial defense. Effective fraud detection requires models that balance high accuracy and adaptability to emerging fraud patterns. Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed training for fraud detection while preserving data privacy and ensuring legal compliance. However, traditional FL approaches operate as black-box systems, limiting the analysts to trust, verify, or even improve the decisions made by AI in fraud detection. Explainable AI (XAI) enhances fraud analysis by improving interpretability, fostering trust, refining classifications, and ensuring compliance. The integration of XAI and FL forms a privacy-preserving and explainable model that enhances security and decision-making. This research proposes an Explainable FL (XFL) model for financial fraud detection, addressing both FL’s security and XAI’s interpretability. With the help of Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and LIME, analysts can explain and improve fraud classification while maintaining privacy, accuracy, and compliance. The proposed model is trained on a financial fraud detection dataset, and the results highlight the efficiency of detection and successful elimination of false positives and contribute to the improvement of the existing models as the proposed model attained 99.95% accuracy and a miss rate of 0.05%, paving the way for a more effective and comprehensive AI-based system to detect potential fraudulence in banking. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence (ai); Financial Fraud Detection; Fl; Secure And Transparent Banking; Shap; Xai; Xfl","","","","","Abbas, Sagheer, Smart Vision Transparency: Efficient Ocular Disease Prediction Model Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence, Sensors, 24, 20, (2024); Banking Law and Financial Regulations the Imperatives for Managing Stability in the Banking Sector, (2025); Al-Dahasi, Ezaz Mohammed, Optimizing fraud detection in financial transactions with machine learning and imbalance mitigation, Expert Systems, 42, 2, (2025); Al-Hashedi, Khaled Gubran, Financial fraud detection applying data mining techniques: A comprehensive review from 2009 to 2019, Computer Science Review, 40, (2021); Askari, Sikdar Md S., Credit card fraud detection using fuzzy ID3, 2017-January, pp. 446-452, (2017); Authorea Preprints, (2024); Managing A Company in an Environment with Significant Corruption, (2024); Journal of Accounting and Finance, (2020); Behera, Tanmay Kumar, Credit Card Fraud Detection: A Hybrid Approach Using Fuzzy Clustering & Neural Network, pp. 494-499, (2015); Bharati, Subrato, Federated learning: Applications, challenges and future directions, International Journal of Hybrid Intelligent Systems, 18, 1-2, pp. 19-35, (2022)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","19118074","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003438286"

Experts foresee that AI tools will improve cyber threat detection and reduce response time to cyber attacks. Yet gen AI also increases the risks of social engineering attacks and unauthorized data disclosure. To mitigate these risks and harness the benefits of gen AI, central banks anticipate a need for substantial investments in human capital, especially in staff with expertise in both cyber security and AI programming.

This is challenging due to the nonlinearity of responses hindering the discretionary definition of models, as well as the confoundedness of observational training data. This paper investigates the application of data-driven and machine learning (ML) methods to estimate individual bid responses.

Market sentiment is extracted from tweets related to PT Bank Jago Tbk using sentiment analysis based on Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is then combined with historical stock price fluctuations. Several machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks, are applied to evaluate the predictive performance of stock prices. The results show that the linear regression-based model provides the most accurate predictions, with lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) compared to other models. Furthermore, the model that relies solely on historical stock price data delivers predictions that are almost as accurate as the model integrating Twitter sentiment. Consequently, this study indicates that sentiment analysis from Twitter has a limited impact on the case of PT Bank Jago Tbk, although its potential to influence stock markets in other companies or sectors still warrants further exploration.

The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was extended by incorporating three additional constructs: subjective norms, which capture the social influence of close relationships, including family and friends; personal innovativeness, which reflects the openness to new technologies that is characteristic of Generation Z; and perceived trust, which addresses concerns related to security and reliability that are critical in financial contexts, thereby enhancing our understanding of this phenomenon among Generation Z. A survey of 292 Generation Z respondents was collected and structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed for data analysis. The findings of the study reveal that factors such as perceived usefulness, attitude, subjective norms, personal innovativeness, and perceived trust all have a significantly positive impact on Generation Z’s intention to use AI-enabled VAs in banking. Additionally, the results indicate that perceived usefulness is influenced by ease of use, while attitude is affected by ease of use, perceived usefulness, personal innovativeness, and trust. Despite the Saudi government’s support and initiatives for the development of the AI-fintech industry, there is still a lack of understanding about consumer behavioral intention toward AI-enabled VAs in Saudi Arabia and, particularly among Generation Z.

Banking malware variants are also continuing to evolve and have been increasing in numbers for many years. Amongst these, the banking malware Zeus and its variants are the most prevalent and widespread banking malware variants discovered. This prevalence was expedited by the fact that the Zeus source code was inadvertently released to the public in 2004, allowing malware developers to reproduce the Zeus banking malware and develop variants of this malware. Examples of these include Ramnit, Citadel, and Zeus Panda. Tools such as anti-malware programs do exist and are able to detect banking malware variants, however, they have limitations. Their reliance on regular updates to incorporate new malware signatures or patterns means that they can only identify known banking malware variants. This constraint inherently restricts their capability to detect novel, previously unseen malware variants. Adding to this challenge is the growing ingenuity of malicious actors who craft malware specifically developed to bypass signature-based anti-malware systems. This paper presents an overview of the Zeus, Zeus Panda, and Ramnit banking malware variants and discusses their communication architecture. Subsequently, a methodology is proposed for detecting banking malware C&C communication traffic, and this methodology is tested using several feature selection algorithms to determine which feature selection algorithm performs the best. These feature selection algorithms are also compared with a manual feature selection approach to determine whether a manual, automated, or hybrid feature selection approach would be more suitable for this type of problem. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automated Feature Selection; Banking Malware; Binary Classification Algorithms; Machine Learning; Manual Feature Selection; Zeus Malware Variants","","","","","International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science, (2017); Cybercrime to Cost the World 10 5 Trillion Annually by 2025, (2020); undefined; Iosr J Comput Eng, (2020); Etaher, Najla, From ZeuS to zitmo: Trends in banking malware, 1, pp. 1386-1391, (2015); undefined, (2024); Cyber Secur, (2024); Mishra, Ruchi, Behavioral Study of Malware Affecting Financial Institutions and Clients, pp. 79-86, (2020); Owen, Harry, A Survey on Botnets, Issues, Threats, Methods, Detection and Prevention, Journal of Cybersecurity and Privacy, 2, 1, pp. 74-88, (2022); Powering the Digital Economy Opportunities and Risks of Artificial Intelligence in Finance, (2021)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","2624800X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000854770"

Design/methodology/approach: To test the hypotheses, an empirical study with a questionnaire was carried out. The study was completed by 362 Palestinian customers who use online banking services. Findings: The findings of this paper show that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions significantly influence consumer attitudes toward AI-powered online banking. Furthermore, trust in financial institutions as a moderating variable strengthens the impact of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions on consumer attitudes toward AI-powered online banking. Therefore, more studies should focus on certain fields and cultural contexts to get a more thorough grasp of the variables influencing adoption and acceptability. Research limitations/implications: The study's findings may be specific to the Palestinian context, limiting generalizability. The reliance on self-reported data and a cross-sectional design may constrain the establishment of causal relationships and the exploration of dynamic attitudes over time. In addition, external factors and technological advancements not captured in the study could influence Palestinian consumer attitudes toward AI-powered online banking. Practical implications: Financial institutions can leverage the insights from this research to tailor their strategies for promoting AI-powered online banking, emphasizing factors like perceived security and ease of use. Efforts to build and maintain trust in financial institutions are crucial for fostering positive consumer attitudes toward AI technologies. Policymakers can use these findings to inform regulations and initiatives that support the responsible adoption of AI in the financial sector, ensuring a more widespread and effective implementation of these technologies. Originality/value: This research delves into Palestinian consumer attitudes toward AI-powered online banking, focusing on trust in financial institutions. It aims to enrich literature by exploring this under-explored area with meticulous examination, robust methodology and insightful analysis. The study embarks on a novel journey into uncharted terrain, seeking to unearth unique insights that enrich the existing literature landscape.

This advancement has widened the cyberspace and attack surface, which has led to a drastic increase in cyberattacks. Cybersecurity solutions have also evolved. The advancement is relatively slower in developing countries. However, the financial sector in developing countries has shown resistance to cyberattacks. This paper investigates the reasons for this resistance. Despite using legacy systems, the banking sector in Pakistan has demonstrated resistance to cyberattacks. The research used a qualitative approach. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine cybersecurity experts in the banking sector to illustrate the reasons for this cybersecurity resistance. The research focused on cybersecurity experts in the banking sector, recognizing that this industry is particularly prone to cyberattacks on a global scale. The study utilised a thematic analysis technique to find resistance factors.

This study investigates the factors influencing AI adoption behavior among various stakeholders in the Greek semi-mature systemic banking ecosystem, addressing a critical gap in the relevant research. By utilizing the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT-2), and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) models, data from 297 respondents (bank employees, digital professionals, and the general public) were analyzed. The results highlight the strong relevance of constructs such as Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, and Hedonic Motivation, whereas Social Influence was deemed non-significant, reflecting a pragmatic stance toward AI. Demographic factors like gender and age were found to have no significant moderating effect, challenging traditional stereotypes. However, occupation and education emerged as significant moderators, indicating varying attitudes among professions and educational levels. This study is the first to develop a theoretical framework for AI adoption by Greek banking institutions, offering Greek banking practitioners actionable insights. The findings also hold relevance for countries with similar digital maturity levels, aiding broader AI integration in banking. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Control Variables; Digital Banking; Education; Pls-sem; Profession; Tam; Utaut-2; Banking; Behavioral Research; Control Variable; Digital Banking; Digital Economy; Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling; Partial Least-squares; Profession; Structural Equation Models; Technology Acceptance Model; The Unified Theory Of Acceptance And Use Of Technology(utaut); Unified Theory Of Acceptance And Use Of Technology 2; Artificial Intelligence","Banking; Behavioral research; Control variable; Digital banking; Digital economy; Partial least square structural equation modeling; Partial least-squares; Profession; Structural equation models; Technology acceptance model; The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT); Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2; Artificial intelligence","","","","Batiz-Lazo, Bernardo, The Spread of Artificial Intelligence and Its Impact on Employment: Evidence from the Banking and Accounting Sectors, Palgrave Studies in Cross-Disciplinary Business Research, In Association with EuroMed Academy of Business, pp. 135-155, (2022); Reinventing Banking and Finance Frameworks to Navigate Global Fintech Innovation, (2020); Papathomas, Aristides, Financial institutions digital transformation: the stages of the journey and business metrics to follow, Journal of Financial Services Marketing, 29, 2, pp. 590-606, (2024); AlNemer, Hashem Abdullah, Determinants of digital banking adoption in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: A technology acceptance model approach, Digital Business, 2, 2, (2022); Boustani, Nada Mallah, Artificial intelligence impact on banks clients and employees in an Asian developing country, Journal of Asia Business Studies, 16, 2, pp. 267-278, (2022); Bilal, Muhammad, Artificial intelligence is the magic wand making customer-centric a reality!

This paper delves into the rapid adoption of AI and machine learning within the financial sector, highlighting their potential to enhance financial stability and productivity. By reviewing research from 2018 to 2023, the study categorizes AI applications in finance into three main areas: cybersecurity, customer services, and financial management. Furthermore, the research identifies and classifies various threats posed to the integrity and stability of the financial system by AI, along with associated challenges for policy and regulatory frameworks. It also addresses the risks and obstacles inherent in deploying AI within financial markets and banking sectors, offering recommended strategies to mitigate these limitations. Despite the recognized advantages, the comprehensive understanding of AI's benefits and drawbacks remains incomplete due to its evolving nature and varied applications in banking. Clear policies governing AI usage are imperative to safeguard financial consumers and promote a fair and transparent financial market. These guidelines should prioritize human decision-making and foster an unbiased approach to policymaking, ultimately fostering innovation within the industry. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Banking; Cyber Security; Financial Sector; Machine Learning","","","","","Sayari, Toumi, Digitalization of the financial sector: New opportunities and challenges during the COVID-19 crisis, pp. 78-98, (2023); Zbornik Radova Ekonomskog Fakulteta U Istocnom Sarajevu, (2019); AI in Finance A Review, (2020); Business Wire, (2020); Shanlax International Journal of Commerce, (2019); Transforming Paradigms A Global AI in Financial Services Survey, (2020); Cao, Yi, A survey of AI in finance, Journal of Chinese Economic and Business Studies, 20, 2, pp. 125-137, (2022); Jagtiani, Julapa A., The roles of alternative data and machine learning in fintech lending: Evidence from the LendingClub consumer platform, Financial Management, 48, 4, pp. 1009-1029, (2019); Xie, Minzhen, Development of Artificial Intelligence and Effects on Financial System, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1187, 3, (2019); Bianchi, Daniele, Bond Risk Premiums with Machine Learning, Review of Financial Studies, 34, 2, pp. 1046-1089, (2021)","","Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science","","","","","","22528938; 20894872","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211155209"

IPOs with strong early excitement average a 29.73% initial return, but suffer a −8.22% long-term industry-adjusted return, showing a gap between early optimism and later results. Analysis of investor communication reveals that financial language and existing information influence these outcomes. There is a growing caution among frequent IPO investors, likely due to past experiences.

This review endeavours to map the existing landscape by identifying the work done so far, delineating the key themes and identifying the focal points of research within this field. Design/methodology/approach: A database search of Scopus and Web of Science (last 20 years) resulted in 377 articles. This was further filtered for ABDC listing, and augmented with manual search. This resulted in a final list of 53 articles which was investigated further using the TCCM (Theory, Context, Characteristics and Methodology) review protocol. Findings: The RAI landscape for credit scoring in the banking industry is multifaceted, encompassing ethical, operational and technological dimensions. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in banking is widespread, aiming to enhance efficiency and improve customer experience. Based on the findings of the systematic literature review we found that past studies on AICS have revolved around four major themes: (a) Advances in AI technology; (b) Ethical considerations and fairness; (c) Operational challenges and limitations; and (d) Future directions and potential applications.

However, adequate financial sources are imperative to stimulate this transition. Financial institutions, particularly banking institutions, play a critical role in fulfilling the financial needs for green energy transition. This study investigates the effects of banking sector development, low-carbon energy investments, economic growth, and trade openness on environmental sustainability. Notably, novel Fourier asymmetric ARDL and artificial intelligence-based neural network methods are used for empirical analysis. The Fourier approach captures nonlinearities in the banking sector development and environment relationship. It is found that the negative shocks of banking sector development and economic growth reduce environmental sustainability. However, the positive effects of low-carbon energy investments and trade openness on environmental quality offer a promising path toward a more sustainable future. The Japanese government should accelerate low-carbon energy investments to accelerate the transition from fossil energy to green energy sources. This transition holds the potential to significantly improve Japan's environmental sustainability and contribute to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 7. In addition, since the decline of the banking sector's development in Japan undermines environmental sustainability, financial planning should be implemented to progress this sector. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asymmetric Fourier Approach; Banking Sector Development; Environmental Sustainability; Finance; Low-carbon Energy Investments; Green Development; Sustainable Development Goals; Zero-carbon; Asymmetric Fourier Approach; Banking Sector Development; Banking Sectors; Economic Growths; Energy Investments; Environmental Sustainability; Fourier Approaches; Low Carbon Energies; Low-carbon Energy Investment; Trade Openness; Clean Energy; Artificial Intelligence; Artificial Neural Network; Banking; Economic Growth; Environmental Impact Assessment; Financial System; Fourier Transform; Industrial Investment; Sustainability; Japan","Green development; Sustainable development goals; Zero-carbon; Asymmetric fourier approach; Banking sector development; Banking sectors; Economic growths; Energy investments; Environmental sustainability; Fourier approaches; Low carbon energies; Low-carbon energy investment; Trade openness; Clean energy; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; banking; economic growth; environmental impact assessment; financial system; Fourier transform; industrial investment; sustainability; Japan","","","","World Meteorological Association Provisional State of the Global Climate in 2023, (2023); Climate Change 2013 the Physical Science Basis, (2025); Yong, Yanlan, Minerals, natural resources, government instability, and growing ecological challenges: Can we achieve SDGs 12 and 13?, Resources Policy, 88, (2024); Baloch, Muhammad Awais, The effect of financial development on ecological footprint in BRI countries: evidence from panel data estimation, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 26, 6, pp. 6199-6208, (2019); Ahmed, Zahoor, Linking economic globalization, economic growth, financial development, and ecological footprint: Evidence from symmetric and asymmetric ARDL, Ecological Indicators, 121, (2021); Distribution of Carbon Dioxide Emissions Worldwide in 2022 by Select Country, (2022); Jacquemin, Julien, Prioritizing the role of renewable fuels and hydrogen networks in the transition towards net zero emissions in Western Europe, Energy, 314, (2025); Rehman, Mobeen Ur, Asymmetric Nonlinear Impact of Oil Prices and Inflation on Residential Property Prices: a Case of US, UK and Canada, Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics, 61, 1, pp. 39-54, (2020); Investopedia, (2020); Global Footprint Network, (2020)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03605442; 18736785","0080319424; 0080328016; 0080340016; 0080311202; 0080305326; 0080316549; 008032780X; 9780080327808","ENEYD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214325257"

It examines issues such as data privacy, cyber security, fraud and consumer protection, as well as ethical concerns like algorithmic bias, fairness and transparency. The study explores ways to create a regulatory environment that supports innovation while ensuring financial stability and consumer protection. It also examines the impact of FinTech innovations, such as mobile banking and block chain, on Tanzania’s legal landscape, providing recommendations for adapting laws to better manage AI and FinTech integration. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a doctrinal legal approach and comparative analysis to assess Tanzanian laws, identifying gaps and proposing solutions. It draws on international legal frameworks and applies both deductive and inductive reasoning, alongside key rules of statutory interpretation, including the mischief rule, literal rule, golden rule and purposive approach. Key Tanzanian laws, such as the Cybercrime Act (2015), the Electronic Transactions Act (2015), the Personal Data Protection Act (2022) and the National Payments System Act (2015), are critically examined. Comparative analysis with international legal standards further highlights areas for improvement and opportunities for legal harmonization. Findings: The study revealed that the existing legal instruments in Tanzania, such as the Cybercrime Act 2015, Electronic Transaction Act 2015 and others, are inadequate in addressing the specific legal challenges posed by AI and FinTech. There is a significant need for specialized legal frameworks that facilitate financial inclusion in the digital economy and protect consumers from potential financial risks associated with emerging technologies. The integration of AI and FinTech has democratized access to financial services but has also introduced unforeseen legal complexities and regulatory gaps. Originality/value: This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the impact of AI on Tanzania’s financial sector. Its originality and value stem from its focused exploration of AI’s influence on FinTech, detailed legal analysis and practical legislative reform recommendations. The discussion provides insights into the local legal framework and its preparedness to handle the complexities introduced by AI and automated contracts. This localized analysis fills a significant gap in the literature, offering valuable information for policymakers and scholars interested in FinTech.

The study uses a descriptive methodology to evaluate how robotic process automation systems enhance the different dimensions of internal audit efficiency: planning, management, execution, and communication. The study designed a structured questionnaire for data collection. The sample consisted of 12 commercial bank employees whose working processes are directly affected by robotic process automation system procedures which puts them in a unique position to comment on the practical applicability of this technology and its implications for internal audit. In this study, 480 electronic questionnaires were distributed via Google Forms, and 390 completed forms were collected for further analysis. The study employs descriptive statistics and advanced statistical techniques, such as linear regression analysis, for data analysis. The findings indicate that robotic process automation systems enhance the internal audit process by reducing the cost of operations, eliminating human errors, and smoothing work processes. The robotic process automation system will allow continuous auditing, real-time risk management, and proper reporting; hence, it will change the role of internal auditors and, in the end, improve organizational compliance and performance.

Customer churn in the context of financial institutions is defined as the phenomenon of customers terminating their relationship with a bank. The central tenet of this research project was to devise and develop predictive models of artificial intelligence that can help address the issue of customer churn from the banking perspective. The dataset of banking customer churn prediction used for this analysis comprises a comprehensive set of data about customers from a leading financial institution. It includes extensive customer records, each described by features representing different dimensions of customer behavior and demographics. The three most influential algorithms were selected for this study: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XG-Boost. Each model has different strengths that are quite appropriate for the intrinsic complexities of the customer churn forecast. Random Forest was the best in terms of accuracy among the models, with a relative accuracy, which may indicate that this algorithm fits the underlying pattern in the data best. The integration of AI-driven churn prediction models in the US financial sector has far-reaching implications for banks, enhancing their operational efficiency and customer relationship management. First and foremost, it can identify at-risk customers with a high degree of accuracy, thus helping the banks to implement focused retention strategies that can bring down the churn rate significantly. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Banking Industry; Customer Churn; Machine Learning; Predictive Modelling; Us Financial Sector","","","","","Computer Science IT Research Journal, (2024); Empowering Entrepreneurial Mindsets with AI, (2024); Montaser, Md Abdullah Al, Sentiment analysis of social media data: Business insights and consumer behavior trends in the USA, Edelweiss Applied Science and Technology, 9, 1, pp. 545-565, (2025); Journal of Engineering and Technology, (2024); Journal of Computer Science and Technology Studies, (2024); International Journal of Advanced Engineering Technologies and Innovations, (2024); Journal of Engineering and Technology, (2024); Hasan, Md Rokibul, Developing and implementing AI-driven models for demand forecasting in US supply chains: A comprehensive approach to enhancing predictive accuracy, Edelweiss Applied Science and Technology, 9, 1, pp. 1045-1068, (2025); Journal of Computer Science and Technology Studies, (2024); Journal of Business and Management Studies, (2024)","","Creative Publishing House","","","","","","27526798; 27526801","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219653172"

Many banks have used technology and creativity to improve service efficiency and revenue sustainability due to worries about the detrimental effects of human intelligence. Our research analyses how AI integration influences sustainable banking and service efficiency in selected Nigerian listed banks. Natural language processing, machine learning, and predictive analytics are revolutionising banking. In addition, risk management, fraud detection, customer service, and operational automation applications create data privacy, ethical, and regulatory compliance issues, though they are efficient and cost-effective. According to a cross-sectional study of clients from five Nigerian deposit money banks: Access Bank Plc, Fidelity Bank Plc, First Bank Plc, Guarantee Trust Bank Plc, and Zenith Bank Plc, 384 individuals completed the self-administered questionnaire SAQ. In this study, the following methods were used: Mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, Jarque Bera, correlational analysis, and OLS regression. The researchers observed that AI awareness, application, and effectiveness have an impact on the service efficiency of a subset of Nigerian quoted deposit money banks. Finance firms in Nigeria use AI to improve productivity and client happiness as one suggestion was to automate tedious tasks for bank services. However, government regulations restrict Nigerian banks' AI usage. To bridge these gaps, the paper recommends banking AI regulations, infrastructural development, education, training, and monitoring. The paper also recommends that Nigerian officials automate identity verification and risk assessment to speed up procedures. Overall, there should be strong sustainability, security, and privacy laws to promote economic and social objectives. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Financial Technology; Nigerian Banking Sector; Operational Performance; Sustainable Service Efficiency","","","","","Olmo, Begoña Torre, Sustainable banking, market power, and efficiency: Effects on banks’ profitability and risk, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 3, pp. 1-23, (2021); Gallego-Gómez, Cristina, Artificial intelligence as an enabling tool for the development of dynamic capabilities in the banking industry, International Journal of Enterprise Information Systems, 16, 3, pp. 20-33, (2020); Rahman, Mahfuzur, Adoption of artificial intelligence in banking services: an empirical analysis, International Journal of Emerging Markets, 18, 10, pp. 4270-4300, (2023); International Journal of Information Management, (2022); Ali, Mohammad Sami, EVALUATING THE ROLE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE AUTOMATION OF THE BANKING SERVICES INDUSTRY: EVIDENCE FROM JORDAN, Humanities and Social Sciences Letters, 10, 3, pp. 383-393, (2022); Reviews of Contemporary Business Analytics, (2023); International Journal of Advanced Economics, (2023); Omoge, Akinyemi Paul, Disruptive technology and AI in the banking industry of an emerging market, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 40, 6, pp. 1217-1247, (2022); Agarwal, Pragati, Artificial Intelligence Adoption in the Post COVID-19 New-Normal and Role of Smart Technologies in Transforming Business: a Review, Journal of Science and Technology Policy Management, 15, 3, pp. 506-529, (2024); Computer Science IT Research Journal, (2023)","","Institute for Oil, Gas, Environment, Energy and Sustainable Development, Afe Babalola University","","","","","","24678406; 24678392","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219002947"

This research uses a qualitative method with a sentiment analysis approach with the help of Orange Data Mining. The data used are reviews of the Aladin digital Sharia Bank application from the Google Play Store taken from January 1, 2022, to January 1, 2024. The total review data used in this study included 23,787 reviews. The results revealed that the three most frequently occurring words are ""bank"", ""aladin"", and ""aplikasi (in English: application)”. In addition, there are various positive sentiment words that describe the advantages and benefits provided by the app, such as “mudah (in English: easy)"", ""aman (in English: safe)"", ""bagus (in English: great)"", ""lancar (in English: smooth)"", ""cepat (in English: fast)"", “simple (in English: simple)”, “membantu (in English: to helping)”, and “memudahkan (in English: to facilitate)”. Most reviews with positive sentiments amounted to 15,999 reviews, or 67.26% of all total reviews used in this study. Positive sentiment reviews are reviews that contain praise for user satisfaction when the Aladin digital Islamic bank application is used. The findings of this study offer recommendations for digital sharia banking practitioners to enhance the accessibility and usability of the features and services provided within the application. This is underscored by the fact that a significant portion of negative sentiment in user reviews stems from dissatisfaction related to technical issues within the application. This research is limited by the use of Google Play Store review data from two years before the release of the Aladin digital Sharia Bank app. For future research, researchers advise reidentifying the sentiment of the sharia digital bank application after 3 years, 4 years, etc., to compare sentiment changes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital Sharia Bank; Google Play Store; Machine Learning; Reviews; Sentiment Analysis","","","","","Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Alam, Md Kausar, External Sharī‘ah audit and review committee Vis-a-Vis Sharī‘ah compliance quality and accountability: A case of Islamic banks in Bangladesh, Journal of Public Affairs, 22, 1, (2022); Alnsour, Ibrahim Radwan, Technological turbulence as hindrance between factors influencing readiness of senior management and implementing blockchain technology in Jordanian Islamic banks: a structural equation modeling approach, Journal of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, 13, 1, (2024); Alqtati, Nael, Mining Arabic Twitter conversations on health care: a new approach to analysing Arabic language on social media, Journal of Islamic Marketing, 13, 12, pp. 2649-2671, (2022); Anwar, Moch Khoirul, Business Success of Asnāf Women's Entrepreneur: an Islamic Law Perspective, Al-Ihkam: Jurnal Hukum dan Pranata Sosial, 19, 2, pp. 1-26, (2024); J Tianjin Univ Sci Technol, (2022); Aysan, Ahmet Faruk, Fintech Strategies of Islamic Banks: A Global Empirical Analysis, FinTech, 1, 2, pp. 206-215, (2022); Bajdor, Paula, Data mining approach in evaluation of sustainable entrepreneurship, Procedia Computer Science, 176, pp. 2725-2735, (2020); Impact of Tourism and Digital Media on the Dynamics of the Fashion Industry in the Global Creative Economy, (2024); Berakon, Izra, Impact of digital Sharia banking systems on cash-waqf among Indonesian Muslim youth, Journal of Islamic Marketing, 13, 7, pp. 1551-1573, (2022)","","Malque Publishing","","","","","","26751240","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218902910"

Traditional security measures, including Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and CAPTCHA, often fall short against the sophistication of these attacks, necessitating more advanced and proactive defense strategies. This study explores the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in cybersecurity, particularly in mitigating credential-stuffing threats. AI-driven solutions enable real-time threat detection, predictive analysis, and adaptive authentication, providing enhanced protection by analyzing large datasets to identify unusual login patterns and behaviors. Despite their promise, AI and ML adoption in cybersecurity faces challenges, including data privacy concerns, the risk of false positives and negatives, and scalability barriers. This research also examines emerging technologies, such as federated learning and blockchain-based authentication, which offer decentralized and privacy-preserving approaches to combating credential-stuffing attacks. Ultimately, AI and ML present the banking sector with powerful tools to build resilient, adaptable, and efficient defenses against evolving cyber threats. By integrating these technologies with complementary innovations, financial institutions can enhance security, protect customer trust, and address the dynamic landscape of credential-based cyberattacks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive Authentication; Ai; Credential-stuffing; Machine Learning; Stolen Credentials; User Behaviour Analytics","","","","","Credential Stuffing, (2019); State of Credential Stuffing Attacks, (2021); Tuijin Jishu Journal of Propulsion Technology, (2023); Credential Stuffing Attacks What are They and how to Combat Them, (2020); Int J of Creative Res Thoughts, (2021); Barkworth, Ashley, Detecting IMAP Credential Stuffing Bots Using Behavioural Biometrics, pp. 7-15, (2022); Kirkbride, Philip, Openbullet: Credential stuffing for script kiddies and career criminals, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research, 9, 3, pp. 879-880, (2020); undefined, (2022); Record, (2024); AP News, (2024)","","Prof.Dr. İskender AKKURT","","","","","","21499144","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218780387"

Given its critical role in maintaining banking stability, effective credit risk forecasting methods are essential. In light of this, various studies have introduced techniques to analyze, detect, and prevent bank credit defaults. In this paper, we present a new approach for predicting credit risk, known as the “Method of Separating the Learning Set into Two Balls.” This method involves partitioning a learning set into two distinct categories: the ”Performing Ball,” which contains feature vectors of customers with non-defaulting credits, and the ”Non-Performing Ball,” which includes vectors of customers with defaulting credits. To predict a customer's default risk, it is sufficient to determine which ball their feature vectors belong to. If a customer's vectors do not fall into either category, additional analysis is required for making a credit decision. We evaluated the performance of this method through extensive experimental tests and a comparative analysis. The findings suggest that our approach shows considerable promise for enhancing credit risk prediction in the banking sector. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Neural Network; Credit Risk Prediction; Logistic Regression; Method Of Separating The Learning Set Into Two Balls; Predictive Modeling; Risk Management","","","","","Soui, Makram, Rule-based credit risk assessment model using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, Expert Systems with Applications, 126, pp. 144-157, (2019); Martínez-Sánchez, José Francisco, Assessment of a credit scoring system for popular bank savings and credit, Contaduria y Administracion, 61, 2, pp. 391-417, (2016); Hand, David J., Statistical classification methods in consumer credit scoring: A review, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

By analyzing a complete dataset, the research identifies macroeconomic variables such as interest rates and rise, together with crucial success drivers such as GDP growth, leverage, and liquidness ratios. We can investigate linear and non-linear connections by mixing several mechanism learning models, such as ARIMA and Random Woodland. However, different banks' risk profiles and strategic prospects can be better understood through situation analysis and PCA-based clustering. The findings prove that rising GDP is a robust measure of economic wealth, but inflation cuts into pays. Institutions that are vulnerable to interest rate variations benefit from interest rates. Gathering shows that various banks adopt separate financial strategies, and scenario analysis shows that monetary results are very sensitive to changes in influence. By faithfully depicting financial doubt, the proposed models demonstrate pliability even during economically unstable times like the 2008 monetary crisis. This research emphasizes the importance of proactive risk organization and specialized forecasting tactics; upcoming studies should use hybrid modeling methodologies and join more macroeconomic variables.

Large shareholders tended to favor more AI disclosures, whereas the board of directors either did not support or adopted a more conservative stance on disclosure. Research limitations/implications: This study acknowledges a limitation in the dataset; initially comprising 100 annual reports, it was later refined to meet regression analysis assumptions. Despite this limitation, the study’s insightful results contribute significantly to our understanding of the dynamic relationship between AI disclosure and the performance of top-tier banks in the USA. Originality/Value: By investigating the impact of AI disclosure, the study aims to provide insights into the broader considerations associated with artificial intelligence disclosures in the US banking sector. This study also analyzes how stakeholders respond to the disclosed information about artificial intelligence. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai; Banks; Disclosure; Financial Performance; Financial Reporting","","","","","Management Science Letters, (2021); Aguilera, Ruth, Corporate governance and social responsibility: A comparative analysis of the UK and the US, Corporate Governance: An International Review, 14, 3, pp. 147-158, (2006); Ali, Mohammad Sami, EVALUATING THE ROLE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE AUTOMATION OF THE BANKING SERVICES INDUSTRY: EVIDENCE FROM JORDAN, Humanities and Social Sciences Letters, 10, 3, pp. 383-393, (2022); Alkaraan, Fadi, Corporate transformation toward Industry 4.0 and financial performance: The influence of environmental, social, and governance (ESG), Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 175, (2022); AlSheibani, Sulaiman, Artificial intelligence adoption: AI-readiness at firm-level, (2018); Theoretical Assumptions of Agency Problem Paper Presented at the Second International Symposium on Natural Resources Management Faculty of Management, (2018); Bayo-Moriones, Alberto, A firm-level analysis of determinants of ICT adoption in Spain, Technovation, 27, 6-7, pp. 352-366, (2007); Belkhir, Mohamed, Board of directors' size and performance in the banking industry, International Journal of Managerial Finance, 5, 2, pp. 201-221, (2009); Bhattacharya, Chandrima, Role of Artificial Intelligence in Banking for Leveraging Customer Experience, Australasian Accounting, Business and Finance Journal, 16, 5, pp. 89-105, (2022); Bonsón, Enrique, Artificial Intelligence Disclosure in the Annual Reports of Spanish IBEX-35 Companies (2018–2019), Lecture Notes in Information Systems and Organisation, 44, pp. 147-155, (2021)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","19118074","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215818792"

Crucial evidence illustrates that using chatbots allows banks to enhance business performance and bank–customer relationship. This study aims to unveil how chatbots bring customer experiences and whether customers adopt behavioral outcomes. Structural equation modeling is calculated to examine the hypotheses of a postulated research model with a valid sample of 336 respondents. The results reveal that extrinsic value is investigated because of the central indispensability of chatbot attributes, including understandability, automation, and competence. Meanwhile, understandability, personalization, interaction, and intimacy are of paramount importance in increasing the intrinsic value toward chatbot usage. Intrusiveness tends to inhibit customers’ intrinsic value. Furthermore, extrinsic and intrinsic values significantly predict customer satisfaction and continuance intention toward banking chatbots. Additionally, satisfaction is a motivation for customer intention to sustain the use of banking chatbots. In light of the obtained findings, it is imperative for banks to deem chatbot characteristics as the determinative motivations for customer experience because chatbots provide customers with valuable information and have the capability to address financial issues. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Artificial Intelligence-based Chatbot; Business, Management And Accounting; Consumer Psychology; Customer Experience; Extrinsic Value; Information & Communication Technology (ict); Information Technology; Intrinsic Value; Technology; Vietnam","","","","","Abdulquadri, Abdulazeez Olamide, Digital transformation in financial services provision: a Nigerian perspective to the adoption of chatbot, Journal of Enterprising Communities, 15, 2, pp. 258-281, (2021); Akdim, Khaoula, Perceived value of AI-based recommendations service: the case of voice assistants, Service Business, 17, 1, pp. 81-112, (2023); Alnasr, Firas, Does artificial intelligence (AI) boost digital banking user satisfaction?

This study delves into the interconnectedness between AI and pivotal sectors such as cryptocurrency, blockchain, metaverse, democratized banking, and Cleantech, among others. Employing the conditional autoregressive value-at-risk (CAViaR) and time-varying parameters vector autoregressions (TVP-VAR) methods, we scrutinize daily data spanning from June 1, 2018, to October 11, 2023, encompassing 12 stock indices representing each industry. Our findings unveil a strong contagion effect from AI to other innovative sectors, with the exception of Cleantech, which appears to have decoupled from the AI surge. Notably, democratized banking and the metaverse emerge as key recipients of this contagion. Examination of tail-risk spillovers highlights AI as one of the most influential risk transmitters during market tumult, while cryptocurrency and blockchain consistently function as net risk receivers throughout the sample period. The implications of these findings are multifaceted, offering substantive insights into the risk profiles of these critical innovative sectors.

This study explores deep learning for fraud detection, utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Autoencoders to enhance business practices and reduce fraudulent activities in large organizations. For real-time fraud detection, we propose Graph neural network with lambda architecture while for credit card fraud detection, we use an autoencoder, validated through case studies from two banks. The findings demonstrate that these methods effectively detect fraud with balance of precision and recall, improving the efficiency of banking systems.

Many of the previous works have shown potential non-linearity in tail risk contagion. With the recent advancements in deep learning, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks have played an important role in sequential data prediction. We experiment with LASSO-based neural networks and interpretative LSTM model along with other machine learning approaches for investigating tail risk interconnectedness among the public banks of Japan. We also investigate the risk reception from large overseas banks in United States finding that medium-sized banks are more likely to receive international risks. Our studies show that LSTM-based model is an excellent fit for the scenario and total connectedness goes up during an economic crisis. The banks having larger market capitalization are more prone to emission and reception of tail risks. This is accompanied by exhibiting the impact of some major economic distresses on Japanese banking system.

Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to explore the key factors and barriers influencing employees’ intention to adopt AI in the banking sector using the technology–organisation–environment (T-O-E) framework. Design/methodology/approach This study gathered data from 389 banking employees in the Indian National Capital Region using self-administered questionnaires. The researchers applied “variance-based structural equation modelling” to analyse the collected data and draw insights from the results. Findings The results demonstrate that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use substantially influence employees’ attitudes towards AI adoption. The result also demonstrated that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, top management support and competitive pressure are significantly associated with employees’ behavioural intentions towards AI adoption. However, technological competency and government support insignificantly influence employees’ behavioural intention towards artificial intelligence adoption. Practical implications The findings will empower managers and practitioners to effectively address the opportunities and challenges of AI, fostering its successful integration, enhancing employee experiences and ultimately driving organisational success in a competitive landscape. This study will offer recommendations to AI developers, guiding them to prioritise significant factors, ultimately fostering the smooth adoption of innovative techniques among users. Originality/value This paper is a preliminary attempt to identify the drivers and barriers to and the general perception and accessibility of banking employees towards AI adoption in India. Unlike prior studies, it highlights the unique challenges and opportunities faced by the banking industry using the T-O-E framework. This study also has the potential to assist banks in fine-tuning their AI adoption strategies and offers insights for further studies in the respective domain. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Behavioural Intention; Employees; India; Pls-sem; T-o-e Framework","","","","","National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence, (2023); Journal of Business Economics for Applied Research, (2024); Abdulmuhsin, Amir A., Knowledge management in metaverse: does knowledge storage matter as a factor affecting adoption and acceptance?, International Journal of Organizational Analysis, (2025); Acikgoz, Fulya, Curiosity on Cutting-Edge Technology via Theory of Planned Behavior and Diffusion of Innovation Theory, International Journal of Information Management Data Insights, 3, 1, (2023); Al-Dmour, Hani H., The influence of the practices of big data analytics applications on bank performance: filed study, VINE Journal of Information and Knowledge Management Systems, 53, 1, pp. 119-141, (2023); Belanche, Daniel, Robots or frontline employees?

The study extends the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework by incorporating two key characteristics of AI, i.e. perceived intelligence and perceived anthropomorphism. Methods: It uses the UTAUT as a theoretical framework, and extends it by integrating core features of AI. Data has been collected from 412 respondents in Thailand, and structural equation modeling has been employed for the data analysis. Results: The findings reveal significant positive effects of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, trust, perceived privacy, perceived intelligence and anthropomorphism of AI on users’ behavioral intentions to use mobile banking. Price value, habits, and perceived security do not significantly influence behavioral intentions. The results highlight the transformative potential of AI technology in the mobile banking industry as consumers’ behaviors are greatly influenced by perceived intelligence and anthropomorphism. Discussion: The positive impact of perceived intelligence and anthropomorphism indicates that consumers value advanced, human-like interactions with AI. M-banking platforms may focus on developing AI systems that offer intuitive, intelligent, and emotionally engaging experiences. Financial institutions may invest in AI that can analyze user data to offer personalized financial advice, predict future needs, and automate routine tasks effectively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Financial Services; Fintech; Mobile Banking; Utaut","","","","The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Using quantitative methodology, we collected data from 192 Generation Z respondents in Malaysia through structured questionnaires that measured seven potential influencing factors: perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, awareness, perceived risk, perceived trust, subjective norms and attitude toward AI in banking. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that five factors—perceived usefulness, awareness, perceived trust, subjective norms and attitude—have statistically significant positive effects on adoption intention, explaining 58.3% of the variance. Interestingly, perceived ease of use and perceived risk did not demonstrate significant influence in this context, contrary to some previous research. These findings provide valuable theoretical contributions by validating an extended TAM specifically for AI banking adoption among Generation Z consumers, while offering practical guidance for financial institutions seeking to enhance AI technology acceptance among younger customers. Banks should focus on demonstrating practical benefits, increasing awareness through education, building trust through transparent implementation, leveraging social influence and fostering positive attitudes through engaging experiences. While our study is limited to the Malaysian context, it offers important insights for understanding the technology adoption behaviors of this digitally native generation that will increasingly shape the future of banking services. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Awareness; Banking; Perceived Risk; Perceived Trust","","","","","Albers, Michael J., Quantitative data analysis-in the graduate curriculum, Journal of Technical Writing and Communication, 47, 2, pp. 215-233, (2017); Alkadi, Rotana S., AI in Banking: What Drives Generation Z to Adopt AI-Enabled Voice Assistants in Saudi Arabia?, International Journal of Financial Studies, 13, 1, (2025); Kuwait Chapter of Arabian Journal of Business and Management Review, (2017); Ardiansah, M.

Fintech firms have increased competition within the financial industry, forcing traditional banks to reconsider their operating models and customer engagement strategies. Big nationwide and large regional banks have developed in-house technology to rival the services offered by fintech firms. Smaller banks lack the expertise and other resources needed to develop advanced digital services and are embracing collaboration strategies with fintech firms. This article focuses on two types of collaboration. The first is when a bank uses fintechs’technology so it can offer more innovative products and services to its customers. The second is when a bank partners with a fintech that offers neobanking services, in which the chartered bank provides its core infrastructure so the fintech can offer banking-as-a-service. Using the International Risk Governance Council’s framework, this article identifies key regulatory risks small banks face when implementing these collaboration strategies and provides guidance on how to manage and/or mitigate those risks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Financial Technology; Fintech; Governance; Partnership; Regulatory Arbitrage; Regulatory Compliance; Regulatory Risk Management","","","","","Ha, Dao Thi Thieu, Financial inclusion and fintech: a state-of-the-art systematic literature review, Financial Innovation, 11, 1, (2025); Alt, Rainer, The future of fintech — Towards ubiquitous financial services, Electronic Markets, 34, 1, (2024); Kowalewski, Oskar, The rise of fintech: A cross-country perspective, Technovation, 122, (2023); Ulrich-Diener, Florian, The future of banking: What are the actual barriers to bank digitalization?, BRQ Business Research Quarterly, 28, 2, pp. 491-513, (2025); Arayesh, Mohammad Bagher, Modeling the platform-based banking in commercial banks of Iran, Journal of Banking Regulation, 23, 4, pp. 351-367, (2022); International Journal of Electronic Banking, (2024); Murinde, Victor, The impact of the FinTech revolution on the future of banking: Opportunities and risks, International Review of Financial Analysis, 81, (2022); Ulrich-Diener, Florian, Digital transformation in banking: A managerial perspective on barriers to change, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 4, pp. 1-26, (2021); MacKenzie, Annette, THE FINTECH REVOLUTION, London Business School Review, 26, 3, pp. 50-53, (2015); Knewtson, Heather S., Toward understanding FinTech and its industry, Managerial Finance, 46, 8, pp. 1043-1060, (2020)","","Palgrave Macmillan","","","","","","17456452; 17502071","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012634375"

Using the stimulus-organism-response framework and institutional theory, we explore how industry and stakeholder pressures drive the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and digital banking services, and how these technologies influence sustainability outcomes. Data were collected from Chinese bank employees via the WJX online platform. The analysis employs partial least squares-structural equation modeling to examine direct and indirect effects, along with necessary condition analysis (NCA) to assess necessary conditions for achieving ESP. Our findings confirm that both industry and stakeholder pressures significantly promote AI adoption and digital banking services. Notably, AI adoption exerts a stronger influence on ESP compared to digital banking services. Our results confirm that AI adoption mediates the link between external pressures and sustainability outcomes, while digital banking services only mediate the relationship between industry pressure and ESP. The NCA findings further identify industry pressure and AI adoption as necessary conditions for improving ESP.

AI-driven personalisation has become a crucial way for banks to improve the user experience as they try to keep up with changing client expectations in the digital age. Objective: This study looks at how AI-powered predictive analytics may help personalise the experience for customers and how it affects their experience in digital banking settings. Methods: We used a quantitative study design and a structured questionnaire to ask 200 banking clients who use AI-based digital services. We used SPSS to look at the data. We used reliability testing (Cronbach's Alpha), Pearson correlation, and regression analysis to figure out how predictive analytics, personalisation, and user experience are related. Findings: With a Cronbach's Alpha of 0.908, we could be sure that the instrument was reliable. The findings of a simple linear regression showed that predictive analytics has a big effect on consumer personalisation (R² = 0.737, p < 0.001). The Pearson correlation study showed that there is a strong positive link between personalisation and user experience (r = 0.850, p < 0.01). Also, multiple regression analysis showed that predictive analytics and personalisation together account for 75.9% of the differences in user experience (R² = 0.759, F = 310.264, p < 0.001), which supports all three research hypotheses. Conclusion: The results show how important it is for banks to incorporate predictive analytics in their services to improve customer interactions and satisfaction. Personalisation powered by AI not only makes service better, but it also develops trust and long-term relationships with customers. This study adds to both academic literature and banking practice by showing how important AI is for determining the future of digital consumer interactions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Customer Engagement; Customer Personalization; Digital Banking; Predictive Analytics; Regression Analysis; Spss; User Experience","","","","","International Journal of Communication Networks and Information Security Ijcnis, (2023); Journal of Artificial Intelligence Cloud Computing, (2023); J Contemp Edu Theo Artific Intel Jcetai 102, (2023); Ssrn, (2023); Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences Technology, (2023); International Journal of Finance Ijfin, (2023); In Kurdish Studies Green Publication, (2022); Journal of Artificial Intelligence Cloud Computing, (2023); Journal of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data, (2023); Generative AI in Predictive Maintenance and Performance Enhancement of Solar Battery Storage Systems","","Academic Science Publications and Distributions","","","","","","22297359","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010612794"

The data were collected from May 2008 to May 2014 of a Portuguese bank. This investigation will help to predict the business of the bank and financial inflation and recent trends in bank product and services. The investigation is focused on the classification and prediction of bank telemarketing calls for term deposit product. We have analysed a large dataset of 41,188 observations related with bank client, product, services and socioeconomic attributes. Initially, the dataset was having 150 features and we have selected 21 most relevant features using standard adaptive forward selection and intelligence quotient. We have also compared four machine learning approaches: conditional inference trees (Ctree), recursive partitioning (Rpart), support vector machines (SVM) and random forest. The paper contains an impact analysis of changing training dataset and training time of a model.

The classification results are integrated into live banking systems, enabling continuous 24/7 message processing and instant categorization. Previously, human operators could process up to 70 messages per day during working hours. With AI integration, the system now categorizes messages automatically and in real time, ensuring that relevant department managers receive them promptly, significantly improving operational workflows. Our research offers key insights into applying transformer models for domain-specific classification in banking. This paper presents a case study on fine-tuning transformer models—BERT, GPT-2, GPT-3, and Falcon-1B for domain-specific text classification in the banking industry. The dataset used in this investigation consists of 5,447 customer messages submitted between 2023 and 2024 through Invest Bankś secure messaging portal, which serves as a direct communication channel where customers can submit their requests at any time of the day without needing to visit the bank in person. The inquiries span fifteen service categories provided by the bank. To the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have focused on automating customer secure messages in the banking sector, especially those written in colloquial and abbreviated language. The models were fine-tuned to improve classification accuracy and operational efficiency. A heterogeneous ensemble of BERT and GPT-2 achieved the best performance with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 99.42% and an F1 score of 86.74%. A homogeneous ensemble of BERT models also performed well, achieving an AUC score of 98.81% and an F1 score of 84.57%.

Traditional recommender systems often fail to account for behavioral economic factors and adapt to real-time user interactions, leading to suboptimal nudge strategies. This study attempts to resolve this problem by creating a recommendation model that combines Two-Tower Networks (TWN) and Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) reinforcement learning. The goal is to make nudge-based financial product suggestions that are consistently more effective. The proposed model leverages TWN to generate structured user-product rankings and capture behavioral insights. These rankings serve as input to the MAB model, which continuously refines recommendations through an adaptive exploration-exploitation strategy. In contrast to static suggestion models, MAB changes the weights of different nudge strategies based on how engaged users are in real-time. This approach ensures that financial nudges are personalized and relevant to the user's situation. The model remains stable even when tested with outdated datasets, indicating that it can adapt to changing financial conditions. This study is unique because it uses both deep learning-based representation learning (TWN) and reinforcement-driven decision optimization (MAB). This allows the model to learn autonomously and adapt over time. This study represents a significant step forward in using AI to make financial recommendations. This closes the gap between basic personalization and real-time adaptation. Future studies will focus on using the model in real-life banking settings and improving reward functions to make users more engaged and help them make better financial decisions over time. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive Nudge Strategies; Behavioral Economics In Artificial Intelligence; Customized Financial Recommendations; Multi-armed Bandit (mab); Two-tower Networks (twn); Banking; Behavioral Research; Decentralized Finance; Economics; Recommender Systems; Adaptive Nudge Strategy; Behavioral Economic In Artificial Intelligence; Behavioral Economics; Customized Financial Recommendation; Financial Products; Multi-armed Bandit; Multiarmed Bandits (mabs); Optimisations; Real- Time; Two-tower Network; Deep Learning","Banking; Behavioral research; Decentralized finance; Economics; Recommender systems; Adaptive nudge strategy; Behavioral economic in artificial intelligence; Behavioral economics; Customized financial recommendation; Financial products; Multi-armed bandit; Multiarmed bandits (MABs); Optimisations; Real- time; Two-tower network; Deep learning","","","","Behera, Rajat Kumar, Personalized digital marketing recommender engine, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 53, (2020); Gsc Advanced Research and Reviews, (2024); Elgendy, Nada, DECAS: a modern data-driven decision theory for big data and analytics, Journal of Decision Systems, 31, 4, pp. 337-373, (2022); Chen, Jiawei, Bias and Debias in Recommender System: A Survey and Future Directions, ACM Transactions on Information Systems, 41, 3, (2023); Econ Stud Banking J Demand, (2024); Emami, Amir, The impact of judgment and framing on entrepreneurs’ decision-making, Journal of Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 32, 1, pp. 79-100, (2020); Kottika, Efthymia, We survived this!

Using traditional fraud detection models with only raw transaction data cannot cope with the emerging new and innovative schemes to deceive financial institutions. To increase the detection accuracy of machine learning and deep learning models, we propose a new feature-engineering framework that can produce the most effective feature set for any algorithm by embedding both methods of feature engineering and feature selection into a new framework. In the previous framework, we suggested using a selected dataset that includes new engineered features without any irrelevant features to a target label for any fraud detection algorithms. However, through investigating many related studies in financial fraud detection, we recognized that we selected many different types of machine learning or deep learning for building a fraud detection model. In the experiment, we proved the effectiveness of adopting our new framework by using real-life banking transactional data provided by a private European bank and evaluating the performance of the designed fraud detection models appropriately.

Following Dietterich’s Machine Learning Problem Research Life Cycle, six key steps were implemented: data gathering, preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model creation, training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning. A systematic literature review identified essential machine learning techniques and innovations applied to customer churn prediction since 2014, highlighting Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and hybrid models as practical approaches. This review also emphasized the value of advanced preprocessing and explainable AI techniques in improving model accuracy and usability. A publicly available dataset of 10,000 entries was used to evaluate seven machine learning algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC. Among these, the Gradient Boosting Classifier emerged as the most effective model with an accuracy of 85.2% and an ROC-AUC of 0.87, demonstrating robust performance in predicting customer churn. The findings underscore the potential of Gradient Boosting for developing reliable churn prediction systems, aiding banks in devising targeted customer retention strategies. The results of this study can benefit both academic researchers and industry practitioners. Academics can use the findings to explore advanced machine learning applications and develop new churn prediction frameworks. At the same time, practitioners, particularly in banking and related industries, can leverage the Gradient Boosting model to improve customer retention strategies and reduce revenue losses associated with churn. Future research is recommended to validate these results using dynamic datasets. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking; Churn Rate; Gradient Boosting; Machine Learning","","","","","Ahmad, Abdelrahim Kasem, Customer churn prediction in telecom using machine learning in big data platform, Journal of Big Data, 6, 1, (2019); al-Najjar, Dana, Machine Learning to Develop Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction, Journal of Theoretical and Applied Electronic Commerce Research, 17, 4, pp. 1529-1542, (2022); Amin, Adnan, Customer churn prediction in telecommunication industry using data certainty, Journal of Business Research, 94, pp. 290-301, (2019); Amin, Adnan, Just-in-time customer churn prediction in the telecommunication sector, Journal of Supercomputing, 76, 6, pp. 3924-3948, (2020); Amin, Adnan, Cross-company customer churn prediction in telecommunication: A comparison of data transformation methods, International Journal of Information Management, 46, pp. 304-319, (2019); International Journal of Emerging Technology and Advanced Engineering, (2012); Customer Relationship Management and Customer Retention, (2019); de Caigny, Arno, A new hybrid classification algorithm for customer churn prediction based on logistic regression and decision trees, European Journal of Operational Research, 269, 2, pp. 760-772, (2018); undefined; Journal of Multidisciplinary Developments, (2019)","","IBIMA Publishing","","","","","","19473788","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008824946"

This paper aims to examine the factors influencing consumer intention to utilise AI-powered chatbots in the Saudi banking sector. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive model was formulated by integrating the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) with personal characteristics and AI-related variables, examining their direct effects on behavioural intention alongside the moderating role of knowledge in technology. A questionnaire was distributed among Saudi citizens and 414 complete replies were received. A covariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM) was employed to evaluate the gathered information and examine the hypotheses. Findings: The results confirm that performance expectancy, social influence and attitude positively impact the consumer behavioural intention to use AI chatbots in banking. Conversely, perceived risk negatively affects behavioural intention. Furthermore, perceived intelligence and the anthropomorphism of AI chatbots have a significant positive influence on behavioural intention. Knowledge in technology significantly moderates the effects of performance expectancy, effort expectancy and perceived risk on behavioural intention. Performance expectancy positively mediates the relationship between effort expectancy and behavioural intention, whereas perceived anthropomorphism significantly mediates the effect of perceived intelligence on behavioural intentions.

These models are applied to EPS data from companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange from 2008 to 2019. Multivariate methods are trained using a comprehensive set of 1,598 explanatory variables, encompassing company-specific financial and market metrics along with macroeconomic indicators. The seasonal random walk model demonstrated the lowest error, as measured by the Mean Arctangent Absolute Percentage Error (MAAPE), findings validated through rigorous statistical examinations. Various robustness checks, employing diverse timeframes and error metrics, reaffirm this outcome. The dominance of a simplistic model may arise from the overfitting tendencies of complex models and the relatively straightforward dynamics observed in Polish listed companies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convolution Network; Earnings Per Share; Gradient-boosting Decision Tree; Multilayer Perceptron Network; Random Walk; Warsaw Stock Exchange","","","","","Abarbanell, Jeffery S., Fundamental analysis, future earnings, and stock prices, Journal of Accounting Research, 35, 1, pp. 1-24, (1997); Etemadi, Hossein, Earnings Per Share Forecast Using Extracted Rules from Trained Neural Network by Genetic Algorithm, Computational Economics, 46, 1, pp. 55-63, (2015); Atiya, Amir F., An efficient stock market forecasting model using neural networks, IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks - Conference Proceedings, 4, pp. 2112-2115, (1997); Ball, Ryan T., Automated Earnings Forecasts: Beat Analysts or Combine and Conquer?, Management Science, 64, 10, pp. 4936-4952, (2018); Ball, Ray, SOME TIME SERIES PROPERTIES OF ACCOUNTING INCOME, Journal of Finance, 27, 3, pp. 663-681, (1972); A Guide on Xgboost Hyperparameters Tuning, (2020); Bansal, Naresh, Can we consistently forecast a firm’s earnings?

They partake in the delivery of the services they acquire and assist other customers in making important financial purchase decisions. Customers offering help may also be guided by other customers in the broader service environment (i.e., friends or family members), who may provide support or perform the role of gatekeepers in the helping process. Accordingly, a viewpoint is presented, arguing that value co-creation practices in the service ecosystem may be disrupted when gatekeepers and fellow customer helpers’ support networks engage in knowledge-hiding practices. Potential motivational drivers for knowledge-hiding behaviours are discussed. Additionally, alternative avenues fellow customer helpers may resort to for further assistance are presented. Design/methodology/approach: Bank marketing and broader social literature guided the theoretical investigation. Findings: Knowledge-hiding behaviours may be attributed to feelings of ownership, competition and lack of trust. Customer helpers’ subsequent adaptive behaviours may lead to the development of new service ecosystems that may ignite novel value co-creation practices from new (and perhaps more effective) actors in the system, including different online financial communities, other neighbours or colleagues at work, as well as financial service personnel or a bank’s artificial intelligence technology.

The proposed framework is rigorously evaluated on historical stock data from 60 prominent stocks listed on NASDAQ, NYSE, and S&P 500 indices between 2021 and 2024, a period marked by significant economic shocks, global uncertainty, and structural market shifts. Our experimental results show that our framework consistently outperforms traditional strategies and recent state of the art models, achieving superior metrics including Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, annual return, maximum drawdown, and Calmar ratio.

Regulatory initiatives, including the Sixth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD6) and the AI Act, impose various requirements on AI-systems developers and users. Therefore, this paper aims to discuss the challenges banks face in the AML framework when implementing AI-systems, as well as the need to balance legal compliance with AI’s technological potential. Design/methodology/approach: The discussion on the challenges of AI adoption in banking, considering regulatory initiatives and the search for balance between legal constraints and AI’s technological capabilities, is based on a critical approach. Findings: The AI Act provides developers and users with clear requirements and obligations to minimize the negative consequences of AI development. The rapid pace of digital transformation underscores the need for effective global AML standards. Despite ongoing advancements in AI regulation and AML efforts, the challenge of aligning legal requirements – particularly in terms of explainability, confidentiality, impartiality and data security of AI-systems – with the AI’s technological capabilities in the banking sector remains unresolved. The necessity for the EU to develop specific regulations for AI use in finance has been emphasized. Originality/value: The paper highlights the key challenges in balancing regulatory compliance with the AI’s technological capabilities used by banks to detect transactions potentially related to money laundering.

Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review was carried out to identify the relevant studies. An exhaustive assessment of these studies enables us to identify criteria and sub-criteria affecting artificial intelligence adoption in banks’ credit risk assessments and scoring. Further, a detailed survey was carried out to consolidate views from various segments, such as academics, bank officers and information technology (IT) managers. Then, a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (fuzzy-AHP) prioritized critical success factors. Findings: The study investigates six main barriers (human, organizational, technological, economic, regulatory and environmental) interlocked with 22 sub-barriers impacting the level of AI adoption in credit risk assessments in the banking sector. The findings indicate that organizational factors (0.227) are the most important, followed by environmental (0.189), regulatory (0.177), economic (0.171), technological (0.138) and human (0.098). Research limitations/implications: This study provides a structured understanding of the challenges faced by banks, aiding practitioners in formulating strategies to overcome these barriers. Policymakers and bank executives can leverage these findings to enhance AI implementation and foster innovation in credit evaluation. Originality/value: This study fills a critical research gap by employing the fuzzy-AHP methodology to prioritize success factors for AI adoption in credit risk scoring, a novel approach in the banking context.

Accordingly, this research examines the factors affecting the service quality of AI-enabled neo-banking services and their impact on online brand experience, customer trust and customer loyalty in an emerging economy such as India. Design/methodology/approach: A “cross-sectional design” was employed to collect primary data from 439 consumers through a “self-administered survey questionnaire.” The research used the “partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM)” to analyze the data. Findings: This article provides a robust research model in which personalization, responsiveness and website design significantly influence service quality, while perceived risk insignificantly influences service quality toward AI-enabled neo-banking services. Interestingly, service quality substantially impacts online brand experience, customer trust and customer loyalty. Additionally, online brand experience and customer trust substantially impact customer loyalty towards AI-enabled neo-banking services. Practical implications: This article provides a practical foundation for risk professionals, bank managers, regulators, IT developers, Fintech companies and financial intermediaries planning to develop or invest in similar AI-enabled neo-banking services. In addition, this research unravels deeper structures in neo-banking, which assist in the success of government goals for the digitalization of India.

In response to the call, various regulators established regulatory sandboxes to facilitate innovation and inform the development of new regulatory frameworks. Nevertheless, nine years after establishing the first financial regulatory sandbox, there is no consensus in the literature over the ultimate benefit of establishing a regulatory sandbox. The study conducted a systematic literature review to examine the role and challenges of a regulatory sandbox and propose development guidelines for the effective implementation of a regulatory sandbox. A systematic literature review was conducted through a PRISMA framework with 40 articles from the Clarivate Web of Science and Scopus databases from 2020 to 2024. Thematic and descriptive analysis was conducted to analyse the data. The study established that a regulatory sandbox fosters financial innovation, facilitates effective regulations for innovations, and creates a collaborative learning environment for regulators and innovators. However, regulatory sandboxes are effective in countries with significant Fintech activities and should work hand in hand with other innovation facilitators like the innovation hubs. The literature advocates for improvements in the law governing regulatory sandboxes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Artificial Intelligence; Banking; Financial Innovation; Financial Risk; Incubation Hub; Innovation Hub; Investment & Securities; Management Of It; Regulator-regulatee Social Interaction; Regulatory Sandbox","","","","The author(s) received no financial support for the research.

To solve the above bottlenecks, this paper integrates artificial intelligence and Internet of Things technologies to build a green financial intelligent perception and control system. By applying an AI credit approval model, a real-time environmental data collection mechanism based on the Internet of Things, and a green performance intelligent tracking system, refined dynamic control of key indicators such as the proportion of green credit, environmental risk levels, and customer green satisfaction can be achieved. The experimental results show that the AI deep learning model performs best in green loan risk prediction, with an AUC (Area Under the Curve) value of 0.91, which is significantly higher than the 0.72 of the traditional credit scoring model and the 0.84 of the ESG enhanced model, indicating that the model has a stronger ability to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk loans. In the case of the simulated policy incentive bank, the initial green business accounts for 18.0%. Under the simulated policy incentive, the bank's green business accounts for 33.6%, an increase of 15.6%.

The outcomes bared that perceived intelligence enhanced the propensity of users to adopt mobile banking apps through TTF, perceived cost, and trust. On the other hand, the professed anthropomorphism exhibited a positive effect on users’ perceived cost. Furthermore, the mediation model adjudicated the impact of users’ perceived intelligence and anthropomorphism on perceived risk to be statistically insignificant.

By utilizing a comprehensive dataset from Middle Eastern countries spanning 2011 to 2023, the research applies advanced machine learning techniques, including the Random Forest algorithm, to refine the predictive model. The novelty of this research lies in its detailed exploration of credit risk determinants specific to the Egyptian banking sector, providing valuable insights into emerging economies. A distinction between various types of credit risk and bank classifications is made. The findings reveal that bank-specific factors – such as the asset size, the operating efficiency, the liquidity, the income diversification, and the capital adequacy – are more significant predictors of credit risk than macroeconomic indicators. This trend holds for both listed and non-listed banks, thus highlighting the importance of internal metrics. Moreover, the Random Forest algorithm demonstrates a high accuracy rate in predicting credit risk exposures, which underscores the effectiveness of machine learning in financial settings. The analysis indicates that variations in the asset size, operating efficiency, and other characteristics are crucial in influencing retail and corporate credit risks. These insights suggest that prioritizing internal bank metrics could lead to more effective credit risk management strategies than relying solely on external economic conditions. Ultimately, this study’s predictive model is expected to enhance credit risk assessment capabilities, strengthening the financial positions of banks and fostering economic growth in the region. By bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application, this research offers a novel perspective on credit risk management tailored to the unique context of the Egyptian banking sector. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank-specific; Corporate Credit Risk; Egyptian Banking Sector; Institutional Heterogeneity; Machine Learning Algorithm; Macro-financial Integration; Random Forest; Retail Credit Risk","","","","","Abinzano, Isabel, Sovereign debt holdings and banks’ credit risk: Evidence from the Eurozone, Finance Research Letters, 47, (2022); Ashofteh, Afshin, A conservative approach for online credit scoring, Expert Systems with Applications, 176, (2021); Barra, Cristian, Do microeconomic and macroeconomic factors influence Italian bank credit risk in different local markets?

High-frequency forecasting here is interpreted as nowcasting or interpolation — real-time prediction ahead of official releases or within-period estimation using mixed-frequency indicators — while also serving as a data-augmentation strategy. In the first step, high-frequency predictors are aggregated to construct monthly-aligned features that serve as inputs for training machine learning models. In the second step, various feature selection techniques are evaluated and multiple machine learning algorithms are rigorously fine-tuned via hyperparameter optimization. Through systematic evaluation, a final model was selected — Ridge regression trained on an L1-regularized feature subset — that achieves superior out-of-sample accuracy. This model is then deployed to produce high-frequency year-on-year CPI inflation nowcasts. Forecasts exhibit strong temporal alignment with observed monthly values, while distributional equivalence — monthly vs. high-frequency projections — is confirmed via Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests. Compared to benchmark econometric models, the proposed approach delivers improved predictive performance, offering timely and granular insights for forward-looking monetary policy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data-augmentation; Forecasting; High-frequency Data; Inflation; Machine Learning; Mixed-frequency Models; Nowcasting","","","","","Altansukh, Gantungalag, What is the globalisation of inflation?, Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 74, pp. 1-27, (2017); Baffǐgi, Alberto, Bridge models to forecast the euro area GDP, International Journal of Forecasting, 20, 3, pp. 447-460, (2004); Esparza-Rodríguez, Saúl Alfonso, Inflation forecasts and monetary policy, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 29, 4, pp. 649-684, (1997); Bolivar, Osmar, GDP nowcasting: A machine learning and remote sensing data-based approach for Bolivia, Latin American Journal of Central Banking, 5, 3, (2024); Bulut, Levent, Google Trends and the forecasting performance of exchange rate models, Journal of Forecasting, 37, 3, pp. 303-315, (2018); Clements, Michael P., Macroeconomic forecasting with mixed-frequency data: Forecasting output growth in the United States, Journal of Business and Economic Statistics, 26, 4, pp. 546-554, (2008); Southern Economic Journal, (1990); Eugster, Patrick, Forecasting inflation using sentiment, Economics Letters, 236, (2024); Faust, Jon, Forecasting inflation, Handbook of Economic Forecasting, 2, pp. 2-56, (2013); Applied Economic Forecasting Using Time Series Methods, (2018)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","26661438","","","","English","Article","aip","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005187858"

This research creates an extensive behavioural credit-scoring model through its discovery of crucial psychological characteristics including integrity and self-efficacy and locus of control and materialism that greatly affect credit default and wilful delinquency. A thorough evaluation of the predictive model occurs through logistic regression and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) based analysis on 376 respondent data. Self-efficacy together with internal locus of control and materialism demonstrate significant power as predictors for credit risk and the willingness of individuals to default voluntarily is directly influenced by integrity and self-esteem. The ability of Artificial intelligence approaches to forecasting depends on behavioural constructs to optimize precision accuracy, reduce credit risk estimation errors, and provide opportunities for early prevention. The model delivers 92.1% accurate Default Risk classifications together with 91.0% precise predictions for Liquidity Risk while maintaining a Default Risk AUC-ROC measure of 0.96, which signifies its advanced predictive capabilities.

For the precise prediction of possible risks, including fraud, errors, and financial misstatements, in accounting data, the examination suggests a hybrid Enhanced Flower Pollination Algorithm tuned Gradient Boosting Machines (EFPA-GBM) model. The data was gathered, which included accounting records, financial transactions, and risk-related incidents. The data is preprocessed by handling missing values and normalizing them to ensure quality, followed by principal component analysis (PCA) for feature extraction. EFPA is utilized to improve the model’s parameters for increased accuracy, while GBM is utilized for risk prediction. This AI-driven model continually learns from data, which enables real-time risk analysis and decision-making in contrast to conventional rule-based systems. The performance metrics are evaluated by using Python software in terms of accuracy (94.2%), recall (94%), F1 score (92.9%), precision (93.8%), (Formula presented.) (0.98), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) (0.42), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) (0.6). The experimental findings show that, when it comes to detecting possible risks, the EFPA-GBM model performs better than other conventional risk prediction models. The suggested method improves decision-making and lowers financial vulnerabilities by improving the precision and promptness of risk management in accounting. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence (ai); Enhanced Flower Pollination Algorithm-tuned Gradient Boosting Machines (efpa-gbm); Financial Data; Principal Component Analysis (pca); Risk Management; Banking; Financial Markets; Information Management; Investments; Risk Perception; Accounting System; Artificial Intelligence; Decisions Makings; Enhanced Flower Pollination Algorithm-tuned Gradient Boosting Machine; Financial Data; Gradient Boosting; Principal Component Analyze; Principal-component Analysis; Real Time Analysis; Risks Management; Risk Management","Banking; Financial markets; Information management; Investments; Risk perception; Accounting system; Artificial intelligence; Decisions makings; Enhanced flower pollination algorithm-tuned gradient boosting machine; Financial data; Gradient boosting; Principal component analyze; Principal-component analysis; Real time analysis; Risks management; Risk management","","","","Landi, Giovanni Catello, Embedding sustainability in risk management: The impact of environmental, social, and governance ratings on corporate financial risk, Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management, 29, 4, pp. 1096-1107, (2022); Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Issues, (2021); Kuo, Yafen, Corporate social responsibility, enterprise risk management, and real earnings management: Evidence from managerial confidence, Finance Research Letters, 41, (2021); Huynh, Toan L.D., Financial modelling, risk management of energy instruments and the role of cryptocurrencies, Annals of Operations Research, 313, 1, pp. 47-75, (2022); Du, Guansan, Application of innovative risk early warning mode under big data technology in Internet credit financial risk assessment, Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, 386, (2021); Moschella, Jason, Risk Management in Small- and Medium-Sized Businesses and How Accountants Contribute*, Contemporary Accounting Research, 40, 1, pp. 668-703, (2023); Rashid, Abdul, Corporate governance and risk management in Islamic and convectional financial institutions: explaining the role of institutional quality, Journal of Islamic Accounting and Business Research, 15, 3, pp. 466-498, (2024); Chairani, Chairani, The effect of enterprise risk management on financial performance and firm value: the role of environmental, social and governance performance, Meditari Accountancy Research, 29, 3, pp. 647-670, (2021); Ren, Shaomin, Optimization of Enterprise Financial Management and Decision-Making Systems Based on Big Data, Journal of Mathematics, 2022, (2022); Rodríguez-Espíndola, Oscar, Analysis of the adoption of emergent technologies for risk management in the era of digital manufacturing, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 178, (2022)","","SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","14727978","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004459672"

This study proposes a novel framework integrating topological data analysis (TDA) and machine learning (ML) to enhance default prediction in maritime finance. By constructing correlation-based networks of shipping firms and extracting topological persistence features, such as cyclical trends and structural interdependencies, via Vietoris-Rips complexes, the model captures nonlinear risk patterns overlooked by conventional metrics. Network properties (e.g., centrality, clustering) and financial indicators (loan terms, vessel attributes, economic indices) are synthesized, enabling Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to leverage relational and topological insights. Evaluated on a dataset of shipping loans spanning financial, operational, and macroeconomic variables, the TDA-enhanced models demonstrate significant improvements: logistic regression accuracy rose from 62.8% to 85.1%. At the same time, ROC-AUC for SVM and XGBoost reached 0.931 and 0.973, respectively. Key features like loan amount, vessel age, and debt-to-equity ratios exhibited strong correlations with defaults. Results underscore that incorporating TDA-derived persistence features improves early detection of financial distress, particularly in capturing systemic risks from interconnected market shocks. This hybrid approach offers a robust tool for lenders and policymakers to mitigate defaults in a sector critical to global commerce. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Financial Risk Management; Loan Default Prediction; Risk Analytics; Shipping Industry; Topological Data Analysis; Banking; Financial Markets; Fintech; Information Management; Investments; Logistic Regression; Marine Insurance; Risk Perception; Asset Value; Financial Risk Management; Global Shipping; Hybrid Model; Loan Default; Loan Default Prediction; Machine-learning; Risk Analytic; Shipping Industry; Topological Data Analysis; Risk Management","Banking; Financial markets; Fintech; Information management; Investments; Logistic regression; Marine insurance; Risk perception; Asset value; Financial risk management; Global shipping; Hybrid model; Loan default; Loan default prediction; Machine-learning; Risk analytic; Shipping industry; Topological data analysis; Risk management","","","","Park, Sunghwa, Empirics of Korean shipping companies’ default predictions, Risks, 9, 9, (2021); Alexandridis, George, Corporate financial leverage and M&As choices: Evidence from the shipping industry, Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 133, (2020); Kavussanos, Manolis G., Default risk drivers in shipping bank loans, Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 94, pp. 71-94, (2016); Kavussanos, Manolis G., The determinants of credit spreads changes in global shipping bonds, Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 70, 1, pp. 55-75, (2014); Journal of Applied Corporate Finance, (2011); Grammenos, Costas Th, Estimating the probability of default for shipping high yield bond issues, Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 44, 6, pp. 1123-1138, (2008); Giudici, Paolo S., Fintech Risk Management: A Research Challenge for Artificial Intelligence in Finance, Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence, 1, (2018); Owusu, Ebenezer, A Deep Learning Approach for Loan Default Prediction Using Imbalanced Dataset, International Journal of Intelligent Information Technologies, 19, 1, (2023); Akinjole, Abisola, Ensemble-Based Machine Learning Algorithm for Loan Default Risk Prediction, Mathematics, 12, 21, (2024); Choi, Hyunchul, Predicting financial distress of contractors in the construction industry using ensemble learning, Expert Systems with Applications, 110, pp. 1-10, (2018)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004301395"

And by improving the convolution layer of the convolutional neural network to extract the feature values of the warning indicator data after one dimensionality reduction, the extracted data features are compressed through the pooling layer to achieve a second dimensionality reduction. By utilizing a fully connected layer, the features of the data obtained through secondary dimensionality reduction are transformed into feature vectors and input into the classification layer, thereby achieving multi warning of financial crises in enterprises. Research has shown that after using PCA method to reduce the dimensionality of financial crisis indicators in experimental enterprises, the accuracy of the warning model has increased from the highest 0.83 to 0.75, and the training speed has decreased from 3 seconds to about 1 second; the average absolute error percentage of early warning is about 5.32%.

This research focuses on reliable AI-powered accounting chatbots capable of handling complex financial tasks while enhancing customer communication and user satisfaction. The goal of this study is to establish AI-based chatbots in accounting services to improve financial management assistance and customer communication. This paper presents a novel Raven Roosting-tuned Adaptive Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (RR-ABiLSTM) model designed to classify financial queries and enhance contextual understanding in conversations to improve customer communications. The dataset encompasses both structured and unstructured data from accounting conversations, constituting a domain-specific corpus focusing on common accounting tasks. Data preprocessing included text cleaning and tokenization applied to the acquired data. Subsequently, feature extraction was performed using Word2Vec. The RR algorithm was utilized to optimize hyperparameters and feature selection, while BiLSTM ensures a deep understanding of contextual relationships in conversations, thereby enhancing accuracy and efficiency in processing financial queries. Furthermore, a dynamic training mechanism was integrated, allowing the chatbot to continually adapt to increasing consumer demands without downtime. The proposed method was implemented using Python software, and its performance was compared with traditional algorithms. The overall metrics—F1-score (87.75%), precision (89.25%), recall (86.24%), and accuracy (90%)—illustrate that the suggested model significantly improves customer engagement, reduces the workload of accountants, and enhances the overall efficiency of accounting services by providing reliable financial support. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accounting Services; Ai-based Chatbots; Customer Communication; Financial Management; Raven Roosting-tuned Adaptive Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory (rr-abilstm); Banking; Costs; Customer Satisfaction; Financial Markets; Fintech; Sales; Accounting Service; Artificial Intelligence-based Chatbot; Chatbots; Communication Management; Customer Communications; Digital Tools; Financial Managements; Management Support; Raven Roosting-tuned Adaptive Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory; Short Term Memory; Investments","Banking; Costs; Customer satisfaction; Financial markets; Fintech; Sales; Accounting service; Artificial intelligence-based chatbot; Chatbots; Communication management; Customer communications; Digital tools; Financial managements; Management support; Raven roosting-tuned adaptive bidirectional long short-term memory; Short term memory; Investments","","","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by the Scientific research projects of Tianjin Municipal Education Commission (No. 2024SK129).","Sharabati, Abdel Aziz Ahmad, The Impact of Digital Marketing on the Performance of SMEs: An Analytical Study in Light of Modern Digital Transformations, Sustainability (Switzerland), 16, 19, (2024); Noreen, Umara, Banking 4.0: Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Banking Industry & Consumer’s Perspective, Sustainability (Switzerland), 15, 4, (2023); Cavus, Nadire, An artificial intelligence‐based model for prediction of parameters affecting sustainable growth of mobile banking apps, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 11, (2021); International Journal of Management Entrepreneurship Research, (2024); Haluza, Daniela, Artificial Intelligence and Ten Societal Megatrends: An Exploratory Study Using GPT-3, Systems, 11, 3, (2023); Manta, Alina Georgiana, Industry 4.0 Transformation: Analysing the Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Banking Sector through Bibliometric Trends, Electronics (Switzerland), 13, 9, (2024); Mei, Hengjun, Artificial Intelligence Adoption in Sustainable Banking Services: The Critical Role of Technological Literacy, Sustainability (Switzerland), 16, 20, (2024); Dewasiri, Narayanage Jayantha, Unleashing the challenges of chatbots and ChatGPT in the Banking Industry: Evidence from an emerging economy, pp. 23-37, (2024); Fares, Omar H., Utilization of artificial intelligence in the banking sector: a systematic literature review, Journal of Financial Services Marketing, 28, 4, pp. 835-852, (2023); Wittmann, Xinhua, Adopting AI in the Banking Sector – The Wealth Management Perspective, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 1477 CCIS, pp. 151-162, (2021)","","SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","14727978","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004198037"

The existing literature pays limited attention to the response of the shadow banking system towards collateral monetary policy in the past decade. This paper underscores the distorting effect of collateral monetary policy on the prosperity of the shadow banking system. In addition, this paper also highlights the effects of the New Asset Management Regulation (NAM Regulation) in 2018 which mitigates the stimulation effect of collateral monetary policy on the shadow banking system and bank risks. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP)-Bayesian-XGBoost machine learning methods to investigate the driving role of collateral monetary policy in shadow banking system and bank risks. XGBoost is an ensemble model built on an efficient implementation of decision trees, designed to produce a combined model with superior predictive performance. To interpret results and uncover the “black box” of machine learning in analyzing the relationships between collateral monetary policy, shadow banking system and bank risks, SHAP are employed. Findings: First, the collateral monetary policy simulates the growth of the shadow banking system due to the distorting effect of collateral monetary policy on liquidity distribution. Second, the collateral monetary policy increases bank risks if it stimulates the shadow banking system. Third, the non-primary banks which receive limited liquidity from the central bank are more sensitive to collateral monetary policy and shadow banking system. Fourth, the NAM Regulation in 2018 mitigates the role of collateral monetary policy in the shadow banking system and bank risks. Originality/value: First, this paper fills the research gap by exploring the distorting effect of collateral monetary policy on liquidity distribution and the shadow banking system. Second, it extends the understanding of bank risk by quantifying the responses of bank risk, derived from the negotiable certificate of deposit market to collateral monetary policy. Third, this paper employs the SHAP-XGBoost method to identify and attribute the role of collateral monetary policy in the shadow banking system and bank risk. Fourth, the study investigates how the relationship among collateral monetary policy, shadow banking system and bank risk evolves before and after the 2018 NAM Regulations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank Risk; Collateral Monetary Policy; Interpretable Machine Learning; Shadow Banking System","","","","","Aas, Kjersti, Explaining individual predictions when features are dependent: More accurate approximations to Shapley values, Artificial Intelligence, 298, (2021); Allen, Franklin, Interbank market liquidity and central bank intervention, Journal of Monetary Economics, 56, 5, pp. 639-652, (2009); Allen, Franklin, Entrusted loans: A close look at China's shadow banking system, Journal of Financial Economics, 133, 1, pp. 18-41, (2019); Andrade, Philippe, Can the provision of long-term liquidity help to avoid a credit crunch?

Therefore, this study sets two main objectives. The first objective is to investigate the effect of resampling methods for handling imbalanced data on model effectiveness. The second objective is to compare and evaluate machine learning methods to identify the optimal model for each resampling technique, thereby determining the model that achieves the highest performance. Background In the highly competitive banking industry, attrition of customers is a major challenge for banks trying to improve customer retention. While many studies have focused on building and evaluating models to predict customer churn, they often miss addressing the problem of imbalanced data, which can significantly affect the model’s accuracy. Methodology In this study, following exploratory data analysis (EDA), we apply various techniques to address data imbalance and use a range of machine learning models, including Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and LightGBM, to predict customer churn using the dataset. Contribution The contribution of this research lies in its comprehensive evaluation and comparison of various techniques for handling imbalanced data in churn prediction models. The study identifies SMOTE-ENN as the most effective method for resampling imbalanced data. Among the models tested, LightGBM (accuracy = 0.979) achieves the highest performance based on evaluation metrics. Additionally, the research highlights that tree-based machine learning models generally perform better when trained on imbalanced datasets. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking Industry; Churn Prediction; Classification Models; Hybrid Method; Imbalanced Data; Machine Learning; Oversampling; Undersampling; Adversarial Machine Learning; Contrastive Learning; Data Accuracy; Decision Trees; Sales; Support Vector Machines; Banking Industry; Churn Predictions; Classification Models; Customer Churns; Hybrid Method; Imbalanced Data; Machine Learning Models; Machine-learning; Over Sampling; Under-sampling; Prediction Models","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Data accuracy; Decision trees; Sales; Support vector machines; Banking industry; Churn predictions; Classification models; Customer churns; Hybrid method; Imbalanced data; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Over sampling; Under-sampling; Prediction models","","","This research is funded by the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (UEH).","Aggarwal, Pallav, Customer Churn Prediction in the Telecom Sector, (2024); Ahmad, Abdelrahim Kasem, Customer churn prediction in telecom using machine learning in big data platform, Journal of Big Data, 6, 1, (2019); al-Najjar, Dana, Machine Learning to Develop Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction, Journal of Theoretical and Applied Electronic Commerce Research, 17, 4, pp. 1529-1542, (2022); Amin, Adnan, Customer churn prediction in telecommunication industry using data certainty, Journal of Business Research, 94, pp. 290-301, (2019); Amin, Adnan, Just-in-time customer churn prediction in the telecommunication sector, Journal of Supercomputing, 76, 6, pp. 3924-3948, (2020); Bharathi, S.

The main drawback of SHAP is that it is not portfolio invariant, this is, the explanation for the prediction provided for each observation depends on the portfolio distribution of the features. This can be a serious problem for customers and banking regulators, who expect that explanations will stay stable as long as the clients characteristics do not change. We conduct several tests and show that the SHAP explanation of an observation may considerably change depending on the rest of the portfolio distribution. As a consequence, the explanation of a client may vary over time even if her characteristics do not change and banks using the same model (for ex. commercial models) may provide different explanations to the same client. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Credit Risk; Finance; Machine Learning; Shap; Banking; Contrastive Learning; Decentralized Finance; Investments; Banking Sectors; Commercial Models; Credit Risks; Interventional; Machine Learning Models; Machine-learning; On-machines; Shap; Shapley Value; Adversarial Machine Learning","Banking; Contrastive Learning; Decentralized finance; Investments; Banking sectors; Commercial models; Credit risks; Interventional; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; On-machines; SHAP; Shapley value; Adversarial machine learning","","","The authors are very grateful to the Editor-in-Chief (Martin H.

Although scholarly research has focused either on the implications of machine learning (ML) and deep learning algorithms to improve the performance of the banking and financial sectors or on the applications of AI in specific banking or financial operations, insights into the overall growth of AI in the banking and financial sectors but its applications in diverse functional areas of the banking and financial sectors are relatively scarce. This study aims to present a systematic literature review on the current state of knowledge of AI in banking and the financial sector. A systematic review of 157 articles was conducted to identify, select, assess, and synthesize relevant studies on this phenomenon and was analyzed for emerging themes. The thematic analysis revealed several key themes, including AI as an innovation in customer service, AI applications and customer readiness, AI adoption and financial inclusion, AI adoption and regulation, and AI applications and their explainability. It also identified various applications of, and barriers to, AI adoption. Furthermore, the study proposes a research framework and develops propositions that can be tested in future research.

To this end, we employ quarter-bank level data and various measures for stock price crash risk, ensuring the robustness of our findings. First, we find that the machine learning models can generally perform better than the simple regressions. Next, our results also suggest that textual information from the ECB president’s speeches has significant predictive power. Finally, when we jointly use textual information and macro-financial variables as inputs, the performance of our models is substantially increased compared to models using a single type of input.

The stable operation of the banking industry is not only one of the important factors in achieving sustainable economic growth but also related to the stability of the entire financial system. This research collects data from 507 banks in China from 2000 to 2021, uses the non-performing loan ratio as the measurement indicator of bank risk, and selects indicators from five levels (macroeconomic environment, industry economic environment, economic policy uncertainty, financial openness and bank financial status) On this basis, we use interpretable machine learning models to predict the bank’s default risk, analyze and compare the interpretable machine learning model and the post-hoc explainable methods. The results indicate that Provision Coverage (PC), Loan Provision Coverage (LPC), Liquidity Ratio (LR), and KOF Financial Globalization Index (KOFFiGI) have strong predictive capability for bank default risk.

The aim is to evaluate and determine the most effective model for identifying suspicious transactions, overcoming the challenge of a highly imbalanced dataset. Using data from 565,000 real-world transfers, models based on algorithms such as Random Forest, Neural Networks and Naive Bayes were built and tested. Of these, the Random Forest model proved to be the most robust, achieving 100% accuracy for legitimate transactions and 95.79% accuracy for fraud detection. This level of accuracy reinforces its viability for implementation in real-time banking systems. This result underlines the feasibility of integrating such a model into banking systems for real-time analysis, allowing the interception of dubious transactions.

Conducting a comprehensive analysis, the study explores large-scale feature engineering using demographic, financial and transactional data. This approach not only enhances the complexity and real-world adaptability of churn analysis methodologies but also makes a significant contribution to business analytics in the banking sector. The research stands as a rare example in the literature, utilizing bank customer data within the interest-free financial system, thereby advancing our understanding of customer relationship management in both the operations research and financial sectors. Banks can use these methods to enhance their customer retention strategies, which may result in lower churn rates and higher customer lifetime value. By minimizing customer churn, banks can improve their financial stability and profitability, potentially leading to more consistent lending practices and lower interest rates for customers. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking; Customer Churn; Ensemble Learning; Machine Learning","","","","Open access funding provided by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of T\u00FCrkiye (T\u00DCB\u0130TAK).","Ahn, Jaehyun, A Survey on Churn Analysis in Various Business Domains, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 220816-220839, (2020); Alexandropoulos, Stamatios Aggelos N., Data preprocessing in predictive data mining, Knowledge Engineering Review, 34, (2019); Alfaro Navarro, José Luis, A Fully Automated Adjustment of Ensemble Methods in Machine Learning for Modeling Complex Real Estate Systems, Complexity, 2020, (2020); Ali, Muhammad Ammar, Tuning Accuracy-Diversity Trade-off in Neural Network Ensemble via Novel Entropy Loss Function, pp. 365-368, (2021); al-Najjar, Dana, Machine Learning to Develop Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction, Journal of Theoretical and Applied Electronic Commerce Research, 17, 4, pp. 1529-1542, (2022); Authorea Preprints, (2020); Baltas, Ioannis D., Optimal management of defined contribution pension funds under the effect of inflation, mortality and uncertainty, European Journal of Operational Research, 298, 3, pp. 1162-1174, (2022); Bhunia, Satyajit, Evaluating carbon cap and trade policy effects on a multi-period bi-objective closed-loop supply chain in retail management under mixed uncertainty: Towards greener horizons, Expert Systems with Applications, 250, (2024); Bogaert, Matthias, Ensemble Methods in Customer Churn Prediction: A Comparative Analysis of the State-of-the-Art, Mathematics, 11, 5, (2023); Machine Learning Mastery, (2019)","","Springer","","","","","","15729338; 02545330","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000063419"

The researchers devised a questionnaire comprising three dimensions to accomplish this objective. The initial set of questions pertained to using artificial intelligence applications by the study sample bank, either for customer service purposes or to achieve the bank's objectives. The second set of questions pertained to the accounting programs utilized, their advantages and disadvantages, and their compatibility with advancements in technology and communications. The third dimension encompassed inquiries on the essential attributes necessary for the excellence of financial statements by the criteria set by international financial reporting standards and the Central Bank of Iraq. Out of the 46 banks listed on the Iraq Stock Exchange in 2024, a sample of 31 institutions was chosen. Among them, there were 12 Islamic banks and 19 commercial banks. 217 questionnaires were distributed for analysis, with each bank receiving seven questionnaires for the directors of finance, internal audit, information systems, inspection, research and development, and their assistants to answer the research questions. The hypotheses were tested using IBM SPSS 29.0.10, employing practical analysis and simple and multiple linear regression. The research findings indicate that all banks in Iraq utilize electronic accounting. However, the quality of programs differs across banks based on the scale of financial activities and the amount of money they handle. The research also determined that artificial intelligence is advancing in the applications of banks, except for the Development Bank, the Bank of Baghdad, and the First Bank of Iraq. The study also demonstrates a strong correlation between the implementation of artificial intelligence in accounting and its positive impact on the reliability and accuracy of financial accounts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Commercial Banks; E-accounting Programs; Quality Of Financial Reports","","","","","Abdullah, Abdulwahid Ahmed Hashed, The impact of artificial intelligence and Industry 4.0 on transforming accounting and auditing practices, Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity, 10, 1, (2024); Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, (2024); Polytechnic Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences, (2024); Baviskar, Dipali, Efficient Automated Processing of the Unstructured Documents Using Artificial Intelligence: A Systematic Literature Review and Future Directions, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 72894-72936, (2021); Migration Letters, (2023); World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, (2024); Effect of E Accounting Systems on Financial Performance of Quoted Deposit Money Banks in Anambra State, (2020); International Journal of Multidisciplinary Research and Analysis, (2022); Proceedings of Feb Zagreb International Odyssey Conference on Economics and Business, (2022); Borges, Aline De Fatima Soares, The strategic use of artificial intelligence in the digital era: Systematic literature review and future research directions, International Journal of Information Management, 57, (2021)","","Fintech Aliance LLC","","","","","","23064994; 23108770","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214432105"

In addition to these risks that are challenging for banks to control and manage, crises and disasters can exert substantially more destructive shocks. These shocks can exacerbate internal risks and cause severe damage to the bank's performance, leading banks to bankruptcy and closure. This study aims to facilitate achieving resilient banking policies through a model-based assessment of business continuity management (BCM) policies. Design/methodology/approach: By applying a system dynamics (SD) methodology, a systemic model that includes a causal structure of the banking business is presented. To build a simulation model, data are collected from a commercial bank in Iran. By presenting the simulation model of the bank's business, the consequences of some given crises on the bank's performance are tested, and the effectiveness of risk and crisis management policies is evaluated. Vensim Personal Learning Edition (PLE) software is used to construct the simulation model. Findings: Results indicate that the current BCM policies do not show appropriate resilience in the face of various crises. Commercial banks cannot create sustainable value for the banks' shareholders despite the possibility of profitability, as the shareholders lack adequate resilience and soundness. These commercial banks do not have the appropriate resilience for the next pandemic after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Moreover, the robustness of the current banking business model is very fragile for the banking run crisis. Practical implications: A forward-looking view of resilient banking can be obtained by combining liquidity coverage, stable funding, capital adequacy and insights from stress tests. Resilient banking requires a balanced combination of robustness, soundness and profitability. Originality/value: The present study is a combination of bank business management, risk and resilience management and SD simulation. This approach can analyze and simulate the dynamics of bank resilience. Additionally, present of a decision support system (DSS) to analyze and simulate the outcomes of different crisis management policies and solutions is an innovative approach to developing effective and resilient banking policies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Capital Adequacy; Liquidity Coverage; Organizational Resilience; Resilient Banking; Risk Management; Stable Funding; System Dynamics; Artificial Intelligence; Computer Software; Decision Support Systems; Profitability; Risk Assessment; System Theory; Capital Adequacies; Commercial Bank; Fundings; Liquidity Coverage; Organisational; Organizational Resilience; Resilient Banking; Risks Management; Stable Funding; System Dynamics; Risk Management","Artificial intelligence; Computer software; Decision support systems; Profitability; Risk assessment; System theory; Capital adequacies; Commercial bank; Fundings; Liquidity coverage; Organisational; Organizational resilience; Resilient banking; Risks management; Stable funding; System Dynamics; Risk management","","","","Acharya, Viral V., Measuring systemic risk, Review of Financial Studies, 30, 1, pp. 2-47, (2017); Annarelli, Alessandro, Strategic and operational management of organizational resilience: Current state of research and future directions, Omega (United Kingdom), 62, pp. 1-18, (2016); A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems, (2014); 34th International Conference of the System Dynamics Society, (2016); Bastan, Mahdi, Making the profitability paradox of bad banks: A system dynamics approach, July, pp. 2198-2213, (2019); Bastan, Mahdi, Educational demographics: a system dynamics model for human resource management, International Journal of System Assurance Engineering and Management, 11, 3, pp. 662-676, (2020); Bastan, Mahdi, A new technology acceptance model: a mixed-method of grounded theory and system dynamics, Kybernetes, 51, 1, pp. 1-30, (2022); Berry, Pam M., Cross-sectoral interactions of adaptation and mitigation measures, Climatic Change, 128, 3-4, pp. 381-393, (2015); Ess Bulletin, (2004); Boorman, Jack, The Centennial Resilience Index: Measuring Countries’ Resilience to Shock, Global Journal of Emerging Market Economies, 5, 2, pp. 57-98, (2013)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","0368492X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168883195"

While prior research has explored the systemic risks of stablecoins and their reliance on traditional banking, there has been limited focus on how banking sector shocks affect digital asset markets. This study addresses this gap by analyzing the impact of SVB’s collapse on the stability of major stablecoins—USDC, DAI, FRAX, and USDD—and their relationships with Bitcoin and Tether. Using daily data from October 2022 to November 2023, we found that the SVB incident triggered a series of depegging events, with varying effects across stablecoins. Our results indicate that USDC, often viewed as one of the safer stablecoins, was particularly vulnerable due to its reliance on SVB reserves. Other stablecoins experienced different impacts based on their collateral structures. These findings challenge the notion of stablecoins as inherently safe assets and underscore the need for improved risk management and regulatory oversight. Additionally, this study illustrates how machine learning models, including gradient boosting and random forests, can enhance our understanding of financial contagion and market stability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank Run; Depeg; Machine Learning; Silicon Valley Bank; Stablecoin; Usdc","","","","","Yousaf, Imran, The impact of the SVB collapse on global financial markets: Substantial but narrow, Finance Research Letters, 55, (2023); Pandey, Dharen Kumar, Repercussions of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse on global stock markets, Finance Research Letters, 55, (2023); Aharon, David Yechiam, Too big to fail: The aftermath of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapse and its impact on financial markets, Research in International Business and Finance, 66, (2023); Economic Times, (2023); Lv, Shuli, How Do Fintechs Impact Banks’ Profitability?—An Empirical Study Based on Banks in China, FinTech, 1, 2, pp. 155-163, (2022); Arxiv Preprint, (2023); Runs and Flights to Safety are Stablecoins the New Money Market Funds, (2025); Decentralized Stablecoins and Collateral Risk, (2021); Contagion Risks of Stablecoins Investor Level Evidence from the Terra Shock Ssrn 4473042, (2023); Griffin, John M., Is Bitcoin Really Untethered?, Journal of Finance, 75, 4, pp. 1913-1964, (2020)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","26741032","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216668565"

The primary objective of this systematic literature review is to find barriers associated with the use of AI-enabled cybersecurity systems. A comprehensive systematic literature review approach was implemented in this study. Literature sampled from different databases (Scopus and WOS) was synthesised to synthesise barriers associated with using an AI-enabled cybersecurity system, and a total of 41 papers were selected using systematic inclusion criteria. The study identified several barriers, such as the complexity of systems, lack of top management support, lack of AI-proficient employees, and lack of regulatory support for AI. These barriers are classified into technological, organisational, and environmental. This paper is unique as it focuses on the barriers associated with using advanced technologies such as AI-enabled expert systems for cybersecurity. Thus, the current research makes a novel contribution, arguing that attention is required toward organisational-level issues to protect the system from cyberattacks. This will establish the way for researchers to evaluate these barriers, opening new avenues for empirical research and for practitioners to utilise these systems more effectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Advanced Technologies; Artificial Intelligence; Barriers And Banking; Cybersecurity; Advanced Technology; Banking Sectors; Barrier And Banking; Classifieds; Cyber Security; Primary Objective; Regulatory Support; Synthesised; Systematic Literature Review; Top Management Support","Advanced technology; Banking sectors; Barrier and banking; Classifieds; Cyber security; Primary objective; Regulatory support; Synthesised; Systematic literature review; Top management support","","","","Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Governance Economics and Finance, (2021); Proceedings of the 2020 4th International Symposium on Computer Science and Intelligent Control, (2020); Tounsi, Wiem, A survey on technical threat intelligence in the age of sophisticated cyber attacks, Computers and Security, 72, pp. 212-233, (2018); Guembe, Blessing, The Emerging Threat of Ai-driven Cyber Attacks: A Review, Applied Artificial Intelligence, 36, 1, (2022); Mushtaq, Shahrukh, Critical Factors and Practices in Mitigating Cybercrimes within E-Government Services: A Rapid Review on Optimising Public Service Management, Information (Switzerland), 15, 10, (2024); Islam, Umar, Detection of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks in IOT Based Monitoring System of Banking Sector Using Machine Learning Models, Sustainability (Switzerland), 14, 14, (2022); Hiscox Cyber Readiness Report 2017, (2019); Albshaier, Latifa, Earlier Decision on Detection of Ransomware Identification: A Comprehensive Systematic Literature Review, Information (Switzerland), 15, 8, (2024); Ammirato, Salvatore, The potential of IoT in redesigning the bank branch protection system: An Italian case study, Business Process Management Journal, 25, 7, pp. 1441-1473, (2019); Shodh Sarita, (2020)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20782489","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213082440"

It provides an unconstrained and unconscious approach that can be widely applied to health monitoring systems. In recent years, research has been actively conducted to improve rPPG signals and to extract significant information from facial videos. However, rPPG can be vulnerable to degradation due to changes in the illumination and motion of a subject, and overcoming these challenges remains difficult. In this study, we propose a machine learning-based filter bank (MLFB) noise reduction algorithm to improve the quality of rPPG signals. The MLFB algorithm determines the optimal spectral band for extracting information on cardiovascular activity and reconstructing an rPPG signal using a support vector machine. The proposed approach was validated with an open dataset, achieving a 35.5% (i.e., resulting in a mean absolute error of 2.5 beats per minute) higher accuracy than those of conventional methods. The proposed algorithm can be integrated into various rPPG algorithms for the pre-processing of RGB signals. Moreover, its computational efficiency is expected to enable straightforward implementation in system development, making it broadly applicable across the healthcare field. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Filter Bank; Heart Rate; Machine Learning; Remote Photoplethysmography; Support Vector Machine; Adaptive Boosting; Cardiology; Filter Banks; Image Enhancement; Photoplethysmography; Support Vector Machines; Color Changes; Contact Technologies; Filters Bank; Health Monitoring System; Heart Activities; Heart-rate; Machine-learning; Non-contact; Remote Photoplethysmography; Support Vectors Machine; Heart","Adaptive boosting; Cardiology; Filter banks; Image enhancement; Photoplethysmography; Support vector machines; Color changes; Contact technologies; Filters bank; Health monitoring system; Heart activities; Heart-rate; Machine-learning; Non-contact; Remote photoplethysmography; Support vectors machine; Heart","","","This study was supported by the 2024 Research Fund of the University of Ulsan.","McDuff, Daniel J., Remote measurement of cognitive stress via heart rate variability, pp. 2957-2960, (2014); Fye, W.

Voice authentication is increasingly popular for important mobile processes. The hybrid authentication technique is used in this work to address concerns about forgery attacks in the voice authentication system. Here, we accomplish this goal by using a user authentication approach that decodes passwords from acoustic signals. This method involves the user speaking into the phone to enter their private password. Then, to crack the code, an artificial neural network is employed along with retrieved statistics and speech parameters such as energy and Mel frequency cepstral coefficient. The password numbers are read and saved. The planned application divides the read integers by using the pauses in between the digits. On the other hand, by employing the frequency and phase properties to compare the target's voice to the discovered password key, this method will prevent speech forgeries. This speech and password matching verification system uses our fuzzy nonlinear support vector machine network classification system, which was trained using the Ali Baba and the forty thieves algorithm. Our method is evaluated on a dataset of 30 individuals and three smartphones, achieving an accuracy rate of more than 98.29%. Our system is resistant against a wide range of challenges, including variations in authentication angle, authentication distance, passphrase length, ambient noise, and more, in addition to being device independent. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ali Baba And The Forty Thieves (aft) Algorithm; Forgery Attacks; Fuzzy Nonlinear Support Vector Machine (fuzzy-nl-svm); Mobile Banking; Voice Authentication; Authentication; Smartphones; Support Vector Machines; Ali Baba And The Forty Thief Algorithm; Case-studies; Forgery Attacks; Fuzzy Nonlinear Support Vector Machine; Machine Learning Algorithms; Meta-heuristics Algorithms; Mobile Bankings; Mobile Process; Nonlinear Support Vector Machines; Voice Authentication; Heuristic Algorithms","Authentication; Smartphones; Support vector machines; Ali baba and the forty thief algorithm; Case-studies; Forgery attacks; Fuzzy nonlinear support vector machine; Machine learning algorithms; Meta-heuristics algorithms; Mobile bankings; Mobile process; Nonlinear Support Vector Machines; Voice authentication; Heuristic algorithms","","","","International Journal of Information Computation Technology, (2014); Nautsch, Andreas, Preserving privacy in speaker and speech characterisation, Computer Speech and Language, 58, pp. 441-480, (2019); Shuwandy, Moceheb Lazam, Novel authentication of blowing voiceless password for android smartphones using a microphone sensor, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 81, 30, pp. 44207-44243, (2022); Gupta, Sandeep, Demystifying Authentication Concepts in Smartphones: Ways and Types to Secure Access, Mobile Information Systems, 2018, (2018); Zhu, Chaoyang, Research on Emotion Recognition-Based Smart Assistant System: Emotional Intelligence and Personalized Services, Journal of System and Management Sciences, 13, 5, pp. 227-242, (2023); Shuwandy, Moceheb Lazam, Sensor-Based mHealth Authentication for Real-Time Remote Healthcare Monitoring System: A Multilayer Systematic Review, Journal of Medical Systems, 43, 2, (2019); Obaidat, Mohammad S., Biometric-Based Physical and Cybersecurity Systems, pp. 1-590, (2018); Song, Wenfeng, TalkingStyle: Personalized Speech-Driven 3D Facial Animation With Style Preservation, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 31, 9, pp. 4682-4694, (2025); Chen, Jiajia, A Real-Time Spoofing Detection Method Using Three Low-Cost Antennas in Satellite Navigation, Electronics (Switzerland), 13, 6, (2024); Zhang, Haoran, Fast GNSS acquisition algorithm based on SFFT with high noise immunity, China Communications, 20, 5, pp. 70-83, (2023)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","18756891; 18756883","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210102324"

In bone transplantation, new approaches are needed to provide surgeons with accurate tissue measurements while minimizing contamination risks and avoiding repeated freeze-thaw cycles of banked tissues. This study evaluates three prominent non-contact 3D scanning methods—structured light scanning (SLG), laser scanning (LAS), and photogrammetry (PHG)—to support tissue banking operations. We conducted a thorough examination of each technology and the precision of the 3D scanned bones using relevant anatomical specimens under sterile conditions. Cranial caps were scanned as separate inner and outer surfaces, automatically aligned, and merged with post-processing. A colorimetric analysis based on CIEDE2000 was performed, and the results were compared with questionnaires distributed among neurosurgeons. The findings indicate that certain 3D scanning methods were more appropriate for specific bones. Among the technologies, SLG emerged as optimal for tissue banking, offering a superior balance of accuracy, minimal distortion, cost-efficiency, and ease of use. All methods slightly underestimated the volume of the specimens in their virtual models. According to the colorimetric analysis and the questionnaires given to the neurosurgeons, our low-cost PHG system performed better than others in capturing cranial caps, although it exhibited the least dimensional accuracy. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights for surgeons and tissue bank personnel in selecting the most efficient 3D non-contact scanning technology and optimizing protocols for modernized tissue banking. Future work will advance towards smart healthcare solutions, explore the development of virtual tissue banks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3d Scanning; Bone Banking; Laser Scanning; Photogrammetry; Structured Light Scanners; Electrotherapeutics; Tissue Engineering; Transplantation (surgical); Virtualization; 3d-scanning; Bone Banking; Laser Scanning; Light Scanners; Non-contact; Structured Light; Structured Light Scanner; Three-dimensional Scanning; Tissue Banks; Virtual Tissues; Bone; Article; Artificial Intelligence; Bacterial Growth; Bone Bank; Bone Transplantation; Calibration; Colorimetry; Contamination; Controlled Study; Human; Information Processing; Measurement; Measurement Error; Medical Practice; Neurosurgeon; Photogrammetry; Post Hoc Analysis; Quantitative Analysis; Questionnaire; Statistical Analysis; Procedures; Three-dimensional Imaging; Bone Banks; Humans; Imaging, Three-dimensional; Photogrammetry","Electrotherapeutics; Tissue engineering; Transplantation (surgical); Virtualization; 3D-scanning; Bone banking; Laser scanning; Light scanners; Non-contact; Structured Light; Structured light scanner; Three-dimensional scanning; Tissue banks; Virtual tissues; Bone; Article; artificial intelligence; bacterial growth; bone bank; bone transplantation; calibration; colorimetry; contamination; controlled study; human; information processing; measurement; measurement error; medical practice; neurosurgeon; photogrammetry; post hoc analysis; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; statistical analysis; procedures; three-dimensional imaging; Bone Banks; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Photogrammetry","","","Funding text 1: Scantech's iReal 2E was operated under the proprietary iReal 3D scanning software [24].

We develop China's shadow banking regulation intensity change index using textual analysis and machine learning methods and explore the impacts of the regulation on bank lending. Using a fixed effect model and a dataset of 177 commercial banks in China from 2007 to 2020, we find that strengthened shadow banking regulation results in shrinkage in bank loan scale and lower loan growth. Mechanism analysis reveals that the asset-reallocation motives and profit-seeking motives generated by banks faced with strengthening regulation lead to a decline in bank lending. The credit tightening effect mainly exists in joint-stock, city, and rural commercial banks while insignificant in state-owned banks. This effect can be moderated by ample capital, abundant deposits, and high loan issuance efficiency.

Therefore, the importance of creating early signals is an essential task to undertake to prevent bank failures. We used J48, Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Cost-Sensitive Forest (CSForest) to predict bank failures in the U.S. for 1482 (59 failed) national banks between 2008 to 2010 during the global financial crisis and its aftermath. This research paper stands as a prominent contribution within the existing literature, employing contemporary machine learning algorithms, namely XGBoost and CSForest. Distinguished by its emphasis on mitigating Type-II errors, CSForest, a novel algorithm introduced in this study, exhibits superior performance in minimizing such errors, while XGBoost performed as one of the weakest among the peers. The empirical findings reveal that Logistic Regression maintains its relevance and efficacy, thus underscoring its continued importance as a benchmark model. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking Failure; C45; C53; Csforest; G12; G17; Machine Learning Models; Off-site Monitoring; Xgboost","","","","Open access funding provided by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of T\u00FCrkiye (T\u00DCB\u0130TAK).

This study reveals the barriers to trust in AI by prudential banking supervisors (compliance with regulations). We conducted a qualitative study on the drivers for adoption of explainability technologies that increase transparency and understanding of complex algorithms (some of the underpinning legal principles in the proposed EU AI Act). By using human-centred and ethics-by-design methods coupled with interviews of the key stakeholders from Eastern European private and public banks and IT AI/ML developers, this research has identified the key challenges concerning the employment of AI algorithms. The results indicate a conflicting view of AI barriers whilst revealing the importance of AI/ML systems in banks, the growing willingness of banks to use such systems more widely, and the problematic aspects of implementing AI/ML systems related to their cost and economic efficiency. Keeping up with the complex regulation requirements comes at a significant cost to banks and financial firms. The focus of the empirical study, stakeholders in Ukraine, Estonia and Poland, was chosen because of the fact that there has been a sharp increase in the adoption of AI/ML models in this jurisdiction in the context of its war with Russia and the ensuing sanctions regime. While the “leapfrogging” AI/ML paths in each bank surveyed had its own drivers and challenges, these insights provide lessons for banks in other European jurisdictions. The analysis of four criminal cases brought against top banks and conclusions of the study indicate that the increase in predicate crimes for money laundering, constantly evolving sanctions regime along with the enhanced scrutiny and enforcement action against banks are hindering technology innovation and legal implications of using AI driven tools for compliance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anti-money Laundering; Artificial Intelligence; Banking; Explainability; G21; G28; K23; Machine Learning; O31; Suspicious Transactions; Transparency; Trust","","","","","Opportunities and Challenges of New Technologies for Aml Cft, (2021); Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning and Big Data in Finance Opportunities Challenges and Implications for Policy Makers, (2021); Resolving Regulatory Challenges Mansion House Consulting, (2022); An, Jiafu, Finance, technology and disruption, European Journal of Finance, 27, 4-5, pp. 334-345, (2021); Cutter Business Technology Journal, (2020); Collins, Christopher, Artificial intelligence in information systems research: A systematic literature review and research agenda, International Journal of Information Management, 60, (2021); What is Artificial Intelligence, (2007); Artificial Intelligence Definition Examples and Applications Encyclopedia Britannica, (2022); von Rueden, Laura, Informed Machine Learning - A Taxonomy and Survey of Integrating Prior Knowledge into Learning Systems, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 35, 1, pp. 614-633, (2023); Janiesch, Christian, Machine learning and deep learning, Electronic Markets, 31, 3, pp. 685-695, (2021)","","Palgrave Macmillan","","","","","","17456452; 17502071","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184273380"

Numerous new banking services, products, and business opportunities have resulted as a result. Smart facial authentication is a cutting-edge technology used in mobile banking. Users can utilize this technology to verify their identification by using the facial recognition feature of the camera on their mobile device. This method makes use of complex algorithms that can analyze a person’s face and extract the distinctive characteristics that can be seen there. The attributes of the images of distinct persons are then categorized using learning algorithms and the K-means clustering method. An artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and decision tree (DT) computer system are used to authenticate persons. In this inquiry, the face is used. Additionally, the Wild Horse Optimizer (WHO) method has been used to enhance the precision and optimization of machine learning systems by weighting cluster features. Fuzzy logic is used to make decisions about authentication based on the results of machine learning algorithms. The best feature from a broad dataset is selected using a technique based on evolutionary algorithms. The simulation findings for diverse users have a precision of about 99.78% for user authentication of test samples. Notably, the suggested method reduced the FAR, FRR, and ERR errors by 0.23, 1.13, and 1.1, respectively. It has been proven that using people’s image data may enhance the quality of everyday cameras, and it is anticipated that this work will be applied to mobile banking applications to ensure the verification of rightful owners. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Neural Network; Intelligent Face Authentication; Mobile Banking; Mobile Banking System; Cameras; Decision Trees; Face Recognition; Fuzzy Inference; Fuzzy Neural Networks; Image Enhancement; K-means Clustering; Learning Algorithms; Machine Learning; Online Systems; Banking Industry; Banking Systems; Exponentials; Face Authentication; Financial Transactions; Intelligent Face Authentication; Mobile Banking System; Mobile Bankings; User Friendly; Authentication","Cameras; Decision trees; Face recognition; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Image enhancement; K-means clustering; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Online systems; Banking industry; Banking systems; Exponentials; Face authentication; Financial transactions; Intelligent face authentication; Mobile banking system; Mobile bankings; User friendly; Authentication","","","","Smith-Creasey, Max, Continuous face authentication scheme for mobile devices with tracking and liveness detection, Microprocessors and Microsystems, 63, pp. 147-157, (2018); Journal of Information Processing Systems, (2009); Mohan, Jinu, ENHANCING home security through visual CRYPTOGRAPHY, Microprocessors and Microsystems, 80, (2021); Iosr Jce J Comput Eng, (2013); Stragapede, Giuseppe, Mobile behavioral biometrics for passive authentication, Pattern Recognition Letters, 157, pp. 35-41, (2022); Saxena, Navya, Smart Home Security Solutions using Facial Authentication and Speaker Recognition through Artificial Neural Networks, International Journal of Cognitive Computing in Engineering, 2, pp. 154-164, (2021); Xue, Boyuan, Genotoxicity Assessment of Haloacetaldehyde Disinfection Byproducts via a Simplified Yeast-Based Toxicogenomics Assay, Environmental Science and Technology, 57, 44, pp. 16823-16833, (2023); Towards Assessing and Characterizing the Semantic Robustness of Face Recognition, (2022); Gong, DIhong, A semantic model for video based face recognition, pp. 1369-1374, (2013); Abo El-Soud, Mohamed W., Implicit authentication method for smartphone users based on rank aggregation and random forest, Alexandria Engineering Journal, 60, 1, pp. 273-283, (2021)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","18756891; 18756883","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181847220"

The study is conducted within the theoretical framework of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). The study utilized Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) to examine the data collected from a sample of 364 professionals working in the field of Islamic banking. The results of our study suggest that Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, and Social Influence are important factors in predicting individuals' Behavioural Intention to use Artificial Intelligence (AI). Additionally, the presence of Facilitating Conditions further enhances the impact of these factors on individuals' actual Use Behaviour. Significantly, it was shown that Use Behaviour played a significant role in determining the perceived quality of financial reporting. Nevertheless, the study did not find empirical evidence to demonstrate the direct influence of Behavioural Intention on Financial Reporting Quality. This implies that the actual implementation of Artificial Intelligence is required to fully realize its advantages.

A total of 93 questionnaires from branch heads of Islamic banks were used in this study, and the data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) through descriptive-analytical methods. The findings indicated that AI has a significant influence on the effective application of CG in Islamic banks. The study also revealed that the Covid-19 Pandemic positively moderates the influence of AI on the effective application of CG in Islamic banks. The results of this study have implications for regulators and decision-makers in proposing new legislation to effectively apply CG in the Islamic banking sector, which can help protect public funds and limit cyber-attacks.

Design/methodology/approach: The study was quantitative and cross-sectional and used a sample of 462 respondents drawn through a combination of purposive and convenience sampling techniques. The main method of data analysis was the covariance-based structural equation modeling used to assess the paths relationships, using the Amos v.23 software. Prior to that, a confirmatory factor analysis was done to assess the reliability and validity of the instrument. Findings: The empirical findings support the hypothesized relationship between digital marketing and purchase intention of banks’ services. Consumer engagement partially was found to mediate the association between digital marketing and purchase intentions. Finally, consumer trust moderates the relationship between digital marketing and consumer engagement. Research limitations/implications: Given digital marketing is evolving with new tools and channels coming up by the day, we recommend that future studies should explore others such as search engine marketing, affiliate marketing, content marketing, display advertisement etc. These will help give a broader perspective to the digital marketing strategy and its effect on consumers’ purchase intentions of banks’ services. Practical implications: The study makes a strong case for the use of multi-channel and/or integrative approach, improving digital infrastructure and systems, adopting new and emerging digital tools/channels such as artificial intelligence, chatbots among others to facilitate digital marketing strategy implementation while ensuring active consumer engagement. It further underscores the need for managers to build trust and regularly engage consumers through their digital marketing channels. Originality/value: The integration of the variables in the study provides new empirical understanding and extends knowledge in digital marketing theory. It also serves as a foundation for future studies to explore other areas in the digital marketing, especially from a developing digital economies perspective. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consumer Trust; Digital Marketing; Email Marketing; Engagement; Mobile Marketing; Purchase Intentions; Social Media Marketing","","","","","Abdulquadri, Abdulazeez Olamide, Digital transformation in financial services provision: a Nigerian perspective to the adoption of chatbot, Journal of Enterprising Communities, 15, 2, pp. 258-281, (2021); Agyapong, Daniel, Implications of digital economy for financial institutions in Ghana: an exploratory inquiry, Transnational Corporations Review, pp. 1-11, (2020); Agyei, James, Influence of Trust on Customer Engagement: Empirical Evidence From the Insurance Industry in Ghana, SAGE Open, 10, 1, (2020); Agyei, James, Internet Banking Services User Adoption in Ghana: An Empirical Study, Journal of African Business, 23, 3, pp. 599-616, (2022); Ahmad, Sheraz, E-service quality and actual use of e-banking: Explanation through the Technology Acceptance Model, Information Development, 36, 4, pp. 503-519, (2020); Action Control from Cognition to Behavior, (1985); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Akpan, Ikpe Justice, Small business awareness and adoption of state-of-the-art technologies in emerging and developing markets, and lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, Journal of Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 34, 2, pp. 123-140, (2022); Al-Emran, Mostafa, Examining the roles of students' beliefs and security concerns for using smartwatches in higher education, Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 34, 4, pp. 1229-1251, (2020); Journal of Business and Retail Management Research, (2019)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","02652323","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201020055"

Design/methodology/approach: About 575 valid face-to-face self-administered surveys were gathered using convenience sampling among real bank customers in Turkey. The structural equation modelling was used to test hypotheses involving both direct and moderation effects. Findings: The current study has demonstrated that the AIDUA model is valid and reliable for the acceptance of AIDs in banking service encounters by modifying it. The study results have shown that the acceptance process of AIDs for bank customers consists of three phases. Furthermore, the study’s findings have demonstrated that technology anxiety and risk aversion have adverse moderation effects on the relationship between performance expectancy and emotion as well as on the relationship between emotion and willingness to accept AIDs, respectively. Originality/value: The current study validates the AIDUA model for the banking industry.

Especially, the adoption of AI advisors has a significant impact on trading and investing in the stock market. The purpose of this paper is to test whether AI advisors are less preferred compared to human advisors for investing and whether this algorithm aversion diminishes for trading. Design/methodology/approach: The four hypotheses regarding the direct and indirect relationships between variables are tested in five experiments that collect data from Prolific. Findings: The results of the five experiments reveal that, for investing, consumers are less likely to use AI advisors in comparison to human advisors. However, this reluctance to AI advisors decreases for trading. The author identifies the perceived importance of careful decision-making for investing and trading as the psychological mechanism. Specifically, the greater emphasis on careful decision-making in investing, as compared to trading, leads to consumers’ tendency to avoid AI advisors. Originality/value: This research is the first to investigate whether algorithm aversion varies based on whether one’s approach to the stock market is investing or trading. Furthermore, it contributes to the literature on carefulness by exploring the interaction between a stock market approach and the lay belief that algorithms lack the capability to deliberate carefully. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Algorithm Aversion; Artificial Intelligence; Carefulness; Effort Heuristic; Investing; Trading","","","","This work was supported by a Research Grant of Pukyong National University (2023).","Stock Market A Beginners Guide to Investing and Trading, (2020); Workkeys Talent Assessment User Guide Making the Most of Your Results, (2022); AI in Banking Market, (2021); Atwal, Glyn, Antecedents of intention to adopt artificial intelligence services by consumers in personal financial investing, Strategic Change, 30, 3, pp. 293-298, (2021); Theory and Practice of Computation Proceedings of the Workshop on Computation Theory and Practice Wctp 2018, (2019); Belanche, Daniel, Artificial Intelligence in FinTech: understanding robo-advisors adoption among customers, Industrial Management and Data Systems, 119, 7, pp. 1411-1430, (2019); Bellaiche, Lucas, Humans versus AI: whether and why we prefer human-created compared to AI-created artwork, Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications, 8, 1, (2023); Bigman, Yochanan E., People are averse to machines making moral decisions, Cognition, 181, pp. 21-34, (2018); Brenner, Lukas, Robo-advisors: A substitute for human financial advice?, Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance, 25, (2020); Buczynski, Wojtek, A review of machine learning experiments in equity investment decision-making: why most published research findings do not live up to their promise in real life, International Journal of Data Science and Analytics, 11, 3, pp. 221-242, (2021)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","02652323","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198470834"

To achieve this, it proposes a model based on the paradigm of resistance to innovation and the complexity theory. In addition, it explores the role of gender in relation to chatbot resistance. Design/methodology/approach: Data are collected in France using a snowball sampling technique. The sample is composed of 385 participants. FsQCA is used to identify all possible combinations of usage, value, risk, tradition and image barriers, as well as two gender conditions that predict resistance to chatbots. Findings: The results reveal that the sample provides four possible solutions/combinations that may explain resistance to chatbots. These are: (i) a combination of usage, value, risk and tradition barriers, (ii) a combination of value, risk, tradition and image barriers, (iii) a combination of usage, value, risk and image barriers, along with the male gender and (iv) a combination of usage, value, tradition and image barriers, along with the female gender. Research limitations/implications: This study provides valuable and straightforward theoretical and managerial implications. The proposed solutions suggest a deep understanding of chatbot resistance. Chatbot developers and marketers can highly benefit from these findings to enhance user acceptance. Originality/value: In this study, barriers are envisioned within the larger context of innovation resistance. The interactions among barriers causing resistance to chatbots are examined through the lens of the complexity theory, while the data analysis employs the fsQCA approach.

Design/methodology/approach: By combining databases such as Web of Science and Elton B. Stephens Company (EBSCO), we identified, analyzed and synthesized 53 peer-reviewed empirical articles that explore the connection between digital solutions in the BFSI sector and various phases and constructs of the consumer decision-making process. We examined the dependent variables (DVs) used to operationalize consumer decision-making, performed a thematic analysis of the papers and proposed an integrative framework. Findings: The reviewed articles have garnered more attention from marketing researchers than from BFSI or artificial intelligence scholars, often employing traditional behavioral and experimental methodologies that have several limitations. We identified 38 DVs used to operationalize consumer decision-making, with the most frequently recurring constructs being “Intention to use,” “Utilization,” “Satisfaction,” “Perceived usefulness” and “Trust.” We propose an integrative framework that groups these DVs into three main clusters: subjects’ perceptions, user experience and adoption/usage choice. This systematic literature review highlights the increasing importance of emotion in recent decades and underscores the difficulty of establishing a framework where relationships between variables are direct and unidirectional, as traditional economic theories assume.

Application software refers to programs designed for specific purposes, these applications, often freely available and open source, contribute to the rising number of downloads. In the third quarter of 2022, combined downloads from the Apple App Store and Google Play Reached an estimated 35.3 billion. However, the prevalence of insecurity in these applications and technologies heightens the potential for cybercrimes. Protection against unauthorized intruders is crucial in identifying malicious applications. Machine learning (ML) serves as a promising avenue for detecting malware attacks, offering potential solutions to bolster cybersecurity measures. We propose a novel approach utilizing ML to enhance malware detection accuracy by segmenting datasets into distinct groups. Our research employs supervised ML techniques on the CICMaldroid2020 dataset, which includes comprehensive information such as intent actions, permissions, and sensitive APIs. The dataset was partitioned into four groups, each containing 150 features, and analyzed across four experiments to distinguish between attack and benign classes. Our proposed model demonstrated exceptional performance, with the random forest algorithm achieving an accuracy of 98.6% and a precision of 98.75%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our segmentation approach and its significant contribution to advancing malware detection in Android applications, offering a promising direction for future cybersecurity solutions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adware; Android Operating System; Banking; Cicmaldroid2020; Machine Learning (ml); Malware; Malware Detection; Riskware; Sms Malware; Computer Peripheral Equipment; Adaptive Framework; Cicmaldroid2020; Cyber Security; Machine Learning; Machine-learning; Malware Detection; Malwares; Riskware; Sms Malware; Android Malware","Computer peripheral equipment; Adaptive framework; Cicmaldroid2020; Cyber security; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Malware detection; Malwares; Riskware; SMS malware; Android malware","","","","Alsmadi, Tibra, A Survey on malware detection techniques, pp. 371-376, (2021); Unraveling the Key of Machine Learning Solutions for Android Malware Detection, (2024); Alzaylaee, Mohammed K., DL-Droid: Deep learning based android malware detection using real devices, Computers and Security, 89, (2020); Qiu, Junyang, A Survey of Android Malware Detection with Deep Neural Models, ACM Computing Surveys, 53, 6, (2021); Taher, F., DroidDetectMW: A Hybrid Intelligent Model for Android Malware Detection, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 13, 13, (2023); Chimera an Android Malware Detection Method Based on Multimodal Deep Learning and Hybrid Analysis, (2020); Sahin, Cagri, Do popular apps have issues regarding energy efficiency?, PeerJ Computer Science, 10, (2024); Wajahat, Ahsan, An adaptive semi-supervised deep learning-based framework for the detection of Android malware, Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 45, 3, pp. 5141-5157, (2023); Meijin, Li, A Systematic Overview of Android Malware Detection, Applied Artificial Intelligence, 36, 1, (2022); Droos, Ayat, Android Malware Detection Using Machine Learning, pp. 36-41, (2022)","","International Federation of Engineering Education Societies (IFEES)","","","","","","18657923","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209810139"

Our research focuses on customer churn rate analysis using advanced machine learning (ML) techniques, leveraging a synthetic dataset sourced from the Kaggle platform. The dataset undergoes a preprocessing phase to select variables directly impacting customer churn behavior. SMOTETomek, a hybrid technique that combines oversampling of the minority class (churn) with SMOTE and the removal of noisy or borderline instances through Tomek links, is applied to balance the dataset and improve class separability. Two cutting-edge ML models are applied—random forest (RF) and the Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LGBM) Classifier. To evaluate the effectiveness of these models, several key performance metrics are utilized, including precision, sensitivity, F1 score, accuracy, and Brier score, which helps assess the calibration of the predicted probabilities. A particular contribution of our research is on calibrating classification probabilities, as many ML models tend to produce uncalibrated probabilities due to the complexity of their internal mechanisms. Probability calibration techniques are employed to adjust the predicted probabilities, enhancing their reliability and interpretability. Furthermore, the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method, an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique, is further implemented to increase the transparency and credibility of the model’s decision-making process. SHAP provides insights into the importance of individual features in predicting churn, providing knowledge to banking institutions for the development of personalized customer retention strategies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking Sector; Churn; Classification; Explainable Ai (xai); Probability Calibration","","","","This work was supported by a grant of the Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization, CNCS/CCCDI\u2014UEFISCDI, project number COFUND-DUT-OPEN4CEC-1, within PNCDI IV.","International Journal of Computer Applications, (2016); Gür Ali, F.

This research investigates the dynamic relationship between banking and finance artificial intelligence technology innovation and banks' financial performance across 20 countries using the feasible generalized least squares and the generalized method of moments techniques. The results show that banking and finance artificial intelligence technology innovation positively impacts banks' return on assets, highlighting its role in enhancing financial performance. The interaction term between artificial intelligence innovation and economic growth emphasizes their collaborative positive impact on financial performance. Mediation analysis highlights information and communication technology development's role in transforming artificial intelligence innovation into improved financial outcomes. Considering lagged effects, initial innovation surges correlate with improved financial performance, but prolonged exposure leads to diminishing returns. Moreover, the findings indicate that non-performing loans negatively affect financial performance, underscoring the importance of asset quality. Additionally, regulatory capital and economic growth are positively associated with financial performance, while government regulations exhibit a negative impact. This study highlights the essential role of artificial intelligence technology innovation in banking and finance, emphasizing the need to consider economic and technological factors for maximizing its benefits in enhancing financial performance.

The research addresses a critical need for efficient water use in agriculture, particularly in regions facing spells of both drought and flooding. Using a multi-depth and multi-sensor IoT setup, the real-time data from soil moisture, temperature and water levels at the site were collected and transmitted via NB-IoT technology. The data facilitated the development of virtual soil moisture sensors through machine learning models, specifically Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Such models demonstrated a high accuracy in predicting soil moisture levels, thus reducing the need for frequent physical sensor maintenance. The study's novelty lies in its comprehensive approach combining IoT and advanced machine learning to provide actionable insights for water management, thus enhancing both agricultural productivity and sustainability. Quantitatively, the integration of machine learning models improved water usage efficiency by 37% for jasmine flowers, 28% for date palms, and 19% for pomelo trees.

This research not only seeks to corroborate the AIDUA model in the banking sector, but also aims to enrich it by introducing technological literacy as a moderating factor, particularly in the perspective of sustainable banking. Data were collected through 435 valid, self-administered face-to-face surveys from bank customers in China, determined through convenience sampling. The hypotheses, covering both direct and moderating effects, were examined using structural equation modeling. This study verifies the applicability and reliability of the AIDUA model, in assessing customer acceptance of AIDs within sustainable banking services. The findings indicate that customer acceptance of AIDs unfolds in three distinct phases. Initially, the consumers’ perceptions of social influence (SI), hedonic motivation (HM), and perceived anthropomorphism (PA) positively influence their green performance expectancy (GPE) and green effort expectancy (GEE) concerning AIDs. As a result, greater GPE and GEE among bank customers lead to stronger positive emotions, which greatly contribute to increased AIDs usage and a reduction in resistance to their implementation. Additionally, the findings determine that technological literacy plays a substantial moderating role in the association connecting green performance expectancy and customer emotions in relation to adopting AIDs, thereby highlighting its importance in advancing sustainable banking initiatives. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai Devices; Artificial Intelligence; Green Banking Services; Technological Literacy; Artificial Intelligence; Banking; Literacy; Public Attitude; Technological Development; Technology Adoption; China","artificial intelligence; banking; literacy; public attitude; technological development; technology adoption; China","","","This research was partially supported by the University of Oradea, through the internal grant INO Transfer no. 233/2022.

With a significant portion of the population regularly using credit cards, efforts to enhance financial inclusivity have led to increased card usage. Additionally, the rise of e-commerce has brought about a surge in credit card fraud incidents. Unfortunately, traditional statistical methods used for identifying credit card fraud are time-consuming and may not provide accurate results. As a result, machine learning algorithms have become widely adopted for effective credit card fraud detection. This study addresses the challenge of an imbalanced credit card dataset by employing three sampling strategies: cluster centroid-based majority under-sampling technique (CCMUT), synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), and oversampling technique. The training dataset is then used to train nine machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest (RF), k nearest neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), Ada-boost, Extra-trees, MLP classifier, Naive Bayes, and Gradient Boosting Classifier. The performance of these approaches is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score, and f2 score.

China's local authorities do not have a fixed term, creating an ideal environment for studying how economic agents react to their perception of political uncertainty without an actual political turnover. We implement a machine-learning method to predict the term length of city leaders by observing others with similar backgrounds. Combining this new measurement of political uncertainty and bank- and firm-level data, we find an inverted U-shaped relationship between city leaders' predicted remaining term length and bank loans, corporate liabilities, and investment, which matches the change of political uncertainty over the term.

The analysis unfolds in two stages. I initially benchmark ML's efficacy in forecasting two pivotal banking variables, net charge-off (NCO) and pre-provision net revenue (PPNR), against traditional linear models. Results underscore the superiority of Random Forest and Adaptive Lasso models in this context. Subsequently, I use these models to project PPNR and NCO for selected bank holding companies under adverse stress scenarios. This exercise feeds into the Tier 1 common equity capital (T1CR) densities simulation. T1CR is the equity capital ratio corrected by some regulatory adjustments to risk-weighted assets. Crucially, findings reveal a pronounced left skew in the T1CR distribution for globally systemically important banks vis-à-vis linear models. By mirroring distress akin to the Great Recession, ML models elucidate intricate macro-financial linkages and enhance risk assessment in downturns. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Big Data; Forecasting; Machine Learning; Scenarios; Stress-test","","","","Funding: This work was supported by the Fonds de recherche sur la soci\u00E9t\u00E9 et la culture (Qu\u00E9bec) ; and the canadian chair in Macroeconomy and Forecasting (UQAM) .","Adrian, Tobias, Vulnerable growth, American Economic Review, 109, 4, pp. 1263-1289, (2019); Generalized Random Forests, (2016); Azzalini, Adelchi, Distributions generated by perturbation of symmetry with emphasis on a multivariate skew t-distribution, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

Indeed, a high level of corruption increases bank non-performing loans which in turn reduces profitability and intensifies the fragility of the banking industry. Given the adverse impacts, corruption has been used as one of the factors in bank performance evaluation. As research on corruption-bank performance with machine learning techniques is rarely reported in the literature, this paper presents the empirical comparison of different machine learning algorithms for classifying bank profitability. Besides machine learning performance comparisons, this paper presents the analysis of machine learning features importance to justify the effect of corruption factor in the different machine learning algorithms for classifying bank profitability. The results indicated that all the tested machine learning algorithms present a good ability of classifying bank profitability at accuracy percentages above 70% but corruption index has contributed very minimal effect to the machine learning performances.

Effective safety measures must be adopted to safeguard sensitive financial data and protect clients from potential harm due to the rise in cyber threats that target digital organizations. The aim of this study is to investigates how machine learning algorithms are integrated into cyber security measures in the context of digital banking and its benefits and drawbacks. We initially provide a general overview of digital banks and the particular security concerns that differentiate them from conventional banks. Then, we explore the value of machine learning in strengthening cybersecurity defenses. We revealed that insider threats, distributed denial of service (DDoS) assaults, ransomware, phishing attacks, and social engineering are main cyberthreats that are digital banks exposed. We identify the appropriate machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines (SVM), recurrent neural networks (RNN), hidden markov models (HMM), and local outlier factor (LOF) that are used for detection and prevention cyberthreats. In addition, we provide a model that considers ethical concerns while constructing a cybersecurity framework to address potential vulnerabilities in digital banking systems. The advantages and disadvantages of incorporating machine learning into the cybersecurity strategy of digital banks are outlined using strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats (SWOT) analysis.

It addresses two questions: first, will customers perceive AI technology as a reliable and efficient alternative to traditional banking practices; second, will AI save customers’ time. Design/methodology/approach: The quantitative research method based on regression analysis models was adopted for hypothesis testing, with data collected from a survey of 189 banking customers from four banks, i.e., State Bank of India, Axis Bank, Punjab National Bank, and HDFC Bank in India. Findings: AI improves banking customers’ experiences by making banking more accessible and enjoyable. Satisfied customers are quick to use cutting-edge AI tools. However, human service is more satisfying than digital service. AI has great potential but works alongside humans rather than replacing them. Even though AI’s novel architecture is helpful, human bank tellers are still needed in enhancing customer satisfaction. Originality/value: AI’s integration in Indian banking, propelled by customer satisfaction, foresees a transformative landscape. This study uncovers AI’s role in saving time and improving customer satisfaction. While AI revolutionizes financial processes, its harmonious coexistence with human expertise emphasizes personalized and efficient services.

On the one side, it can offer opportunities, while on the other brings challenges and increases risks. Financial industry is considered the largest user of digital technologies and provider of innovative services. Therefore, it is strongly influenced by digital transformation and under constant threat of cyberattacks. In this paper, the authors are researching the opportunities and risks stemming from the application of AI and its macroeconomic and financial system impacts. The special attention is given to the challenges posed by financial technological development and AI to central banks as they have to adopt to the novel times dominated by electronic financial services and AI tools while at the same time stay persistently dedicated to achieving their key objectives of safeguarding monetary and financial stability as well as contributing to the stability of economic growth. Additionally, the invention of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has significantly influenced processes throughout numerous industries, including the financial sector, due to the ability to imitate human behaviour which has enabled computers to behave like humans. Hence, it is important to develop human-centric innovations where AI tools create benefits and serve people instead of replacing them. AI can deteriorate overall inequality so policymakers should act towards developing policies that will ensure AI is used for the good of people and provide benefits for them.

The varying effects of expansionary and contractionary monetary policy phases on Chinese provinces are highlighted and explained. Subsequently, applying interpretable machine learning, the empirical results show that the credit channel is the main channel affecting the regional impacts of monetary policy. An imminent conclusion of the uneven provincial responses to the “one-size-fits-all” monetary policy is that different policymakers should coordinate their efforts to search for the optimal fiscal and monetary policy mix. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","C54; Causal Machine Learning; China; E52; E61; Monetary Policy; R11; Regional Heterogeneity; Shadow Banking; Economic Impact; Gross Domestic Product; Inflation; Machine Learning; Monetary Policy; Regional Economy; China","economic impact; Gross Domestic Product; inflation; machine learning; monetary policy; regional economy; China","","","","Albuquerque, Bruno, One Size Fits All?

The study centers on Bolivia, where the official monthly indicator of economic growth is released with a substantial delay of up to six months. The proposed nowcast estimates effectively narrow this gap from six to two months. This advancement is achieved through the integration of machine learning techniques with data comprising indicators from traditional sources and statistics derived from satellite imagery. The robustness of this approach is rigorously validated using various criteria, including performance comparisons with conventional econometric methods and sensitivity assessments to different feature sets.

We found that the most important variables for the default risk prediction include the bailout probability, the market share in terms of assets, and the market-to-book ratio, highlighting the relevance of issues like moral hazard and market leverage. On the other hand, for systemic risk prediction, the number of banks in the country and interest rates level are among the most relevant features, indicating that markets with more competition fare better against systemic risks.

We apply natural language processing to current statutes to corroborate our human-reader assessment. Using machine-learning methods, we quantify the extent to which topics in those statutes contribute to the independence measure based on our reading of the statutes. The topic with the largest positive contribution to explaining the cross-country variation in central bank independence encompasses disclosure, transparency, and reporting obligations. The topic with the largest negative contribution covers regulatory powers over inter alia securities markets that complicate the central bank’s mandate, make accountability more complex, and render independence problematic. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Central Banks; History; Independence; Machine Learning","","","","We thank Ayrton Dextre for his assistance in the compilation of historical sources.

It reviews current AI regulation and governance frameworks to provide insights for stakeholders navigating AI integration. A descriptive analysis based on a literature review of recent research is conducted, exploring AI applications, benefits, challenges, regulations, and relevant theories. This study identifies key trends and suggests future research directions. The major findings include an overview of AI applications, benefits, challenges, and ethical issues in the banking and finance industries. Recommendations are provided to address these challenges and ethical issues, along with examples of existing regulations and strategies for implementing AI governance frameworks within organizations. This paper highlights innovation, regulation, and ethical issues in relation to AI within the banking and finance sectors. Analyzes the previous literature, and suggests strategies for AI governance framework implementation and future research directions. Innovation in the applications of AI integrates with fintech, such as preventing financial crimes, credit risk assessment, customer service, and investment management. These applications improve decision making and enhance the customer experience, particularly in banks. Existing AI regulations and guidelines include those from Hong Kong SAR, the United States, China, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and Singapore. Challenges include data privacy and security, bias and fairness, accountability and transparency, and the skill gap. Therefore, implementing an AI governance framework requires rules and guidelines to address these issues. This paper makes recommendations for policymakers and suggests practical implications in reference to the ASEAN guidelines for AI development at the national and regional levels. Future research directions, a combination of extended UTAUT, change theory, and institutional theory, as well as the critical success factor, can fill the theoretical gap through mixed-method research. In terms of the population gap can be addressed by research undertaken in a nation where fintech services are projected to be less accepted, such as a developing or Islamic country. In summary, this study presents a novel approach using descriptive analysis, offering four main contributions that make this research novel: (1) the applications of AI in the banking and finance industries, (2) the benefits and challenges of AI adoption in these industries, (3) the current AI regulations and governance, and (4) the types of theories relevant for further research.

We overcome with such limitation by building several models that also use several years of account transaction data. The objective of this study is to analysis credit card transactions of customers, in order to come up with a good prediction in cross-selling products. We use deep-learning algorithm to analyze almost 800,000 credit cards transactions. The results show that such unique data contains valuable information on the customers’ consumption behavior and it can significantly increase the predictive accuracy of a cross-selling model. In summary, we develop an auto-encoder to extract features from the transaction data and use them as input to a classifier. We demonstrate that such features also have predictive power that enhances the performance of the cross-selling model even further. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Banking; Cross-selling; Deep Learning; Targeted Marketing","","","","","Akter, Shahriar, Transforming business using digital innovations: the application of AI, blockchain, cloud and data analytics, Annals of Operations Research, 308, 1-2, pp. 7-39, (2022); Öztürk, Şule, The derived demand for advertising expenses and implications on sustainability: a comparative study using deep learning and traditional machine learning methods, Annals of Operations Research, 339, 1-2, pp. 131-161, (2024); Bose, Indranil Ronnie, Quantitative models for direct marketing: A review from systems perspective, European Journal of Operational Research, 195, 1, pp. 1-16, (2009); Brown, Sarah C.M., Household finances and the 'Big Five' personality traits, Journal of Economic Psychology, 45, pp. 197-212, (2014); Chaudhuri, Neha, On the platform but will they buy?

However, platelets are susceptible blood cells that require specific storage conditions. The availability of platelet concentrates is limited to five days due to various factors, including the risk of bacterial contamination and the occurrence of physical and functional changes known as platelet storage lesions. In this article, the problems related to platelet storage lesions are categorized into four groups depending on research areas: storage conditions, additive solutions, new testing methods for platelets (proteomic and metabolomic analysis), and extensive data modeling of platelet production (mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, and artificial intelligence).

Thus, this study presents a conversational artificial intelligence agent-based mobile banking app that is specially designed for seniors considering their needs and physical characteristics. Voice modality and lip-movement were identified as the important factors to improve seniors’ mobile banking service experience and the effect of them were empirically tested by conducting a controlled experiment with between-subject design. In total, 91 participants who were 55 years or older used the app to complete the given tasks of online banking. Results showed that those in the two voice modality conditions, compared to text agent condition, reported higher levels of trust, perceived ease of use, and social presence. The effect of lip movement of the agent also showed significant results in those three dependant variables. The result of mediation analysis revealed that agent's lip movement increased social presence and perceived ease of use, which further increased trust toward the agent. The results are meaningful especially because trust and perceived ease of use were listed as the main reason for not using online banking services among non-users. The implications of the study were discussed. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conversational Agent; Lip Movement; Older Adults; Social Presence; Trust; Voice; Behavioral Research; Banking Services; Conversational Agents; Lip Movements; Mobile Bankings; Older Adults; On-line Banking; Perceived Ease-of-use; Social Presence; Trust; Voice Modality; Human Computer Interaction","Behavioral research; Banking services; Conversational agents; Lip movements; Mobile bankings; Older adults; On-line banking; Perceived ease-of-use; Social presence; Trust; Voice modality; Human computer interaction","","","","Agarwal, Ritu, A Conceptual and Operational Definition of Personal Innovativeness in the Domain of Information Technology, Information Systems Research, 9, 2, pp. 204-215, (1998); Journal of Information Engineering and Applications, (2011); Amin, Muslim, User satisfaction with mobile websites: the impact of perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU) and trust, Nankai Business Review International, 5, 3, pp. 258-274, (2014); Balata, Jan, KoalaPhone: touchscreen mobile phone UI for active seniors, Journal on Multimodal User Interfaces, 9, 4, pp. 263-273, (2015); Berry, Paige, Vision and hearing loss in older adults: ""Double trouble, Care Management Journals, 5, 1, pp. 35-40, (2005); Bibault, Jean Emmanuel, Healthcare ex Machina: Are conversational agents ready for prime time in oncology?, Clinical and Translational Radiation Oncology, 16, pp. 55-59, (2019); Bickmore, Timothy W., Acceptance and usability of a relational agent interface by urban older adults, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, pp. 1212-1215, (2005); Biocca, Frank A., Toward a More Robust Theory and Measure of Social Presence: Review and Suggested Criteria, Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments, 12, 5, pp. 456-480, (2003); Bos, Nathan D., Effects of four computer-mediated communications channels on trust development, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, 4, 1, pp. 135-140, (2002); Bouwman, Harry, Information and communication technology in organizations: Adoption, implementation, use and effects, pp. 1-222, (2005)","","Academic Press","","","","","","10715819; 10959300","","IHSTE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189509505"

Combining Random Regression Forests, a machine-learning process, with an agent-based model, we perform simulations on artificial economies with various degrees of adoption of peer-to-peer lending. We find that as peer-to-peer lenders proliferate, there is increased financial instability, lower GDP and higher unemployment. On the other hand, peer-to-peer lending increases the total volume of loans given out but demonstrates a preference towards consumer loans (over corporate loans), which has a negative effect in the long run. Finally, introducing peer-to-peer lenders increases the access of the unbanked to services which conventional banking is not able to offer within the extant regulatory framework. Our results can help policymakers as they address the issue of regulation in the peer-to-peer finance industry. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agent-based Finance; Financial Stability; Machine Learning; P2p Lending; Peer-to-peer; Random Regression Forests; Banking; Economic Activity; Financial System; Gross Domestic Product; Industrial Investment; Lending Behavior; Machine Learning; Performance Assessment; Policy Making; Regression Analysis; Regulatory Framework","banking; economic activity; financial system; Gross Domestic Product; industrial investment; lending behavior; machine learning; performance assessment; policy making; regression analysis; regulatory framework","","","This work was supported by Zayed University Research Incentive Grant #R21082.","Ackert, Lucy F., Information opacity, credit risk, and the design of loan contracts for private firms, Financial Markets, Institutions and Instruments, 16, 5, pp. 221-242, (2007); Allen, Franklin, What do financial intermediaries do?, Journal of Banking and Finance, 25, 2, pp. 271-294, (2001); Babaei, Golnoosh, A multi-objective instance-based decision support system for investment recommendation in peer-to-peer lending, Expert Systems with Applications, 150, (2020); Barrell, Ray J., Costs of financial instability, household-sector balance sheets and consumption, Journal of Financial Stability, 2, 2, pp. 194-216, (2006); Bastani, Kaveh, Wide and deep learning for peer-to-peer lending, Expert Systems with Applications, 134, pp. 209-224, (2019); Berger, Sven Christian, Emergence of Financial Intermediaries in Electronic Markets: The Case of Online P2P Lending, Business Research, 2, 1, pp. 39-65, (2009); How Chinas Peer to Peer Lending Crash is Destroying Lives, (2018); Boyd, John Hayden, Banking crises and crisis dating: Disentangling shocks and policy responses, Journal of Financial Stability, 41, pp. 45-54, (2019); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Breuer, Wolfgang, Magnitude effects in lending and borrowing: empirical evidence from a P2P platform, European Journal of Finance, 26, 9, pp. 854-873, (2020)","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","","","","","10991158; 10769307","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161140815"

Applications in domains of justice, employment and banking are often mentioned in this respect. The main critic is that these applications are biased with respect to so called protected attributes, such as race, gender and age. The most notorious example is the system COMPAS which is still in use in the American justice system despite severe criticism. The aim of our paper is to analyse the trends of discussion about bias in machine learning algorithms using the COMPAS as an example. The main problem we observed is that even in the field of AI, there is no generally agreed upon definition of bias which would enable operational use in preventing bias. Our conclusions are that (1) improved general education concerning AI is needed to enable better understanding of AI methods in everyday applications, and (2) better technical methods must be developed for reliably implementing generally accepted societal values such as equality and fairness in AI systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Bias; Compas; Discrimination; Fairness; Machine Learning; Contrastive Learning; Ai Systems; Banking Is; Bias; Compas; Discrimination; Fairness; General Education; Machine Learning Algorithms; Machine-learning; Operational Use; Adversarial Machine Learning","Contrastive Learning; AI systems; Banking IS; Bias; COMPAS; Discrimination; Fairness; General education; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Operational use; Adversarial machine learning","","","This work was supported by ARIS (Agency of Research and Innovation of Slovenia) and the Ministry of Digital Transition of Slovenia, as part of the research project V2-2272.","Alelyani, Salem, Detection and evaluation of machine learning bias, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 11, 14, (2021); Propublica, (2016); undefined; Berk, Richard A., Fairness in Criminal Justice Risk Assessments: The State of the Art, Sociological Methods and Research, 50, 1, pp. 3-44, (2021); Blanzeisky, William, Algorithmic Factors Influencing Bias in Machine Learning, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 1524 CCIS, pp. 559-574, (2021); Progress in Machine Learning, (1987); Bias in Machine Learning Software Why how What to do, (2021); Measure and Mismeasure of Fairness A Critical Review of Fair Machine Learning, (2018); Courtland, Rachel, Bias detectives: The researchers striving to make algorithms fair news-feature, Nature, 558, 7710, pp. 357-360, (2018); Reuters, (2018)","","Slovene Society Informatika","","","","","","18543871; 03505596","","INFOF","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203253545"

Especially, organizations relying on online platforms provide comparatively better services and have strong relations with their clients. This research also focused on relevant phenomena in the United Arab Emirates banking sector organizations. The researchers employed a cross-sectional design and randomly selected a sample of n=400 individuals. Results revealed a significant impact of customer support services on providing product information (p>0.008) and service quality (p>0.000). Further, the effect of service quality on Artificial Intelligence also remained significant (p>0.000). Besides, Artificial Intelligence is also found significantly impact the Public Relations of Emirati banks (p>0.006). Finally, the mediating impact of communication skills on Artificial Intelligence and Public Relations remained significant (p>0.088). Moreover, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) revealed the Sum of Square Values at 568.19, the Overall Relative Error value at 0.813, and the accuracy level at 18.7% (training). While, regarding the testing, the Sum of Square Values remained at 256.80 and the Average Overall Relative Error value remained at 0.861, indicating an overall accuracy of 13.9%. Thus, it is concluded that the importance of two-way communication can be determined because it helps determine and understand the customers' needs and demands. The more an organization understands its customers, the more it fulfills their expectations, indicating the importance of two-way communication. Finally, this research recommends more studies regarding AI-enabled Emotional Intelligence in other sectors to dig out in-depth results. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Banking Sector; Emotional Intelligence; Public Relations; United Arab Emirates","","","","","Emotional Intelligence Why It can Matter More than IQ, (2006); Jin, Yan, Toward a Publics-Driven, Emotion-Based Conceptualization in Crisis Communication: Unearthing Dominant Emotions in Multi-Staged Testing of the Integrated Crisis Mapping (ICM) Model, Journal of Public Relations Research, 24, 3, pp. 266-298, (2012); Yeomans, Liz, Imagining the lives of others: Empathy in public relations, Public Relations Inquiry, 5, 1, pp. 71-92, (2016); Zhang, Weiwu, Emotional intelligence and public relations: An empirical review, Public Relations Review, 48, 3, (2022); Markovic, Stefan, How does the Perceived Ethicality of Corporate Services Brands Influence Loyalty and Positive Word-of-Mouth?

When fraudulent transactions are vastly outnumbered by non-fraudulent ones, dealing with imbalanced datasets can be difficult. This study aims to determine the best model for detecting fraud by comparing four commonly used machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression. Additionally, we utilized the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address the issue of class imbalance. The XGBoost Classifier proved to be the most successful model for fraud detection, with an accuracy of 99.88%. We utilized SHAP and LIME analyses to provide greater clarity into the decision-making process of the XGBoost model and improve overall comprehension. This research shows that the XGBoost Classifier is highly effective in detecting banking fraud on imbalanced datasets, with an impressive accuracy score. The interpretability of the XGBoost Classifier model was further enhanced by applying SHAP and LIME analysis, which shed light on the significant features that contribute to fraud detection. The insights and findings presented here are valuable contributions to the ongoing efforts aimed at developing effective fraud detection systems for the banking industry. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decision Tree; Fraud Detection; Lime Analysis; Logistic Regression; Machine Learning; Oversampling Smote; Shap Analysis; Svm; Xgboost; Classification (of Information); Crime; Decision Trees; Learning Algorithms; Lime; Logistic Regression; Fraud Detection; Lime Analyse; Logistics Regressions; Machine-learning; Over Sampling; Oversampling Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique; Shap Analyse; Support Vectors Machine; Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Techniques; Xgboost; Support Vector Machines","Classification (of information); Crime; Decision trees; Learning algorithms; Lime; Logistic regression; Fraud detection; LIME analyse; Logistics regressions; Machine-learning; Over sampling; Oversampling synthetic minority over-sampling technique; SHAP analyse; Support vectors machine; Synthetic minority over-sampling techniques; Xgboost; Support vector machines","","","","Awoyemi, John O., Credit card fraud detection using machine learning techniques: A comparative analysis, 2017-January, pp. 1-9, (2017); Mytnyk, Bohdan, Application of Artificial Intelligence for Fraudulent Banking Operations Recognition, Big Data and Cognitive Computing, 7, 2, (2023); Yee, Ong Shu, Credit card fraud detection using machine learning as data mining technique, Journal of Telecommunication, Electronic and Computer Engineering, 10, 1-4, pp. 23-27, (2018); Raval, Jay, RaKShA: A Trusted Explainable LSTM Model to Classify Fraud Patterns on Credit Card Transactions, Mathematics, 11, 8, (2023); Mungwarakarama, Irénée, XTS: A Hybrid Framework to Detect DNS-Over-HTTPS Tunnels Based on XGBoost and Cooperative Game Theory, Mathematics, 11, 10, (2023); Hasib, Khan Md, BMNet-5: A Novel Approach of Neural Network to Classify the Genre of Bengali Music Based on Audio Features, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 108545-108563, (2022); Hasib, Khan Md, A Survey of Methods for Managing the Classification and Solution of Data Imbalance Problem, Journal of Computer Science, 16, 11, pp. 1546-1557, (2020); Maitra, Shithi, Graph Theory for Dimensionality Reduction: A Case Study to Prognosticate Parkinson's, pp. 134-140, (2020); Jahan, Sadia M.Khadija, Active Learning with an Adaptive Classifier for Inaccessible Big Data Analysis, Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2021-July, (2021); Varmedja, Dejan, Credit Card Fraud Detection - Machine Learning methods, (2019)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20782489","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196871549"

However, these methods have limitations such as high false positive rates, low scalability, and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, a novel approach for bank fraud detection using hyper ensemble machine learning (HEML), which combines multiple unsupervised and semi-supervised models with different features and hyperparameters to achieve high accuracy and robustness, including—logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), neural network (NN), one-class SVM (OCSVM), and isolation forest (IF) are studied.The approach is evaluated on a real-world dataset of bank transactions from a large European bank and compared with several baseline methods.The accuracies of base learners and ensemble learners on the test data of LR, DT, SVM, NN, OCSVM and IF are as follows in order 0.95,0.91,0.96, 0.97, 0.93, 0.92. The results show that HEML outperforms the baselines in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC, while reducing the computational cost and human intervention. Additionally, the effectiveness of HEML in detecting new types of frauds that were not seen in the training data is demonstrated. Thus, HEML is a promising technique for bank fraud detection that can adapt to dynamic and complex fraud scenarios. By utilizing multiple models and features, HEML can provide accurate and robust fraud detection while reducing false positives and minimizing human intervention. By employing multiple models and features, HEML has the potential to improve the financial security and stability for both banks and their customers.

The approach compares multiple supervised regression algorithms, such as linear regression, extreme gradient boosting, ordinary least squared, random forest regressor, a linear least-squares L2-regularized, epsilon-support vector regression, and linear support vector regression. Each of these algorithms is associated with different feature selection algorithms to improve the performance of the prediction model. The analysis results revealed that hybridizing algorithms between the highest score percentiles, univariate linear regression, and linear support vector regression perform better according to the root mean squared error and R2-Score measures.

Using a machine learning approach and banks’ 10-K reports, we first measure the corporate culture of selected bank holding companies (BHCs) in the United State (U.S.) over the period between 1995 and 2019. We find that bank culture does affect the link between regulatory capital and liquidity creation. In particular, while we find that regulatory capital has a negative impact on bank liquidity creation, a strong culture in a bank weakens this negative association. We also find that an increase in asset-side liquidity creation is the main channel through which bank culture exerts its moderating role.

Due to data leakage from user information, it is critical to keep the data confidential and completely protected because criminals are looking for this information to attack the system or steal information in the banking sector. To address this issue, this paper suggests an Integrated Blockchain and Artificial intelligence (IBAI) Framework for secure financial transactions. A blockchain can store every customer's data in one place, while AI-driven algorithms can speedily examine that data and make an unbiased decision. The rising blockchain technology provides a decentralized architecture that enables the secure sharing of data and resources to the different networks and is promoted for removing centralized control and resolving the problems of AI. When suspicious behaviour happens, alerts can be triggered to avert theft. Furthermore, registration protocols based on AI are utilized to keep this data in comprehensive security. The numerical results show that the suggested IBAI model enhances the suspicious behaviour detection ratio and increases accuracy up to 98% compared to other models. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Blockchain Technology; Secure Financial Transactions; Artificial Intelligence; Crime; Finance; Network Security; Banking Sectors; Block-chain; Blockchain Technology; Data Leakage; Financial Transactions; Innovative Technology; Secure Financial Transaction; Suspicious Behaviours; Unreliable Network; User Information; Blockchain","Artificial intelligence; Crime; Finance; Network security; Banking sectors; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Data leakage; Financial transactions; Innovative technology; Secure financial transaction; Suspicious behaviours; Unreliable network; User information; Blockchain","","","The author extends the appreciation to the Deanship of Postgraduate Studies and Scientific Research at Majmaah University for funding this research work through the project number (R-2024-1011).","Xiao, Wenjing, Blockchain for Secure-GaS: Blockchain-Powered Secure Natural Gas IoT System with AI-Enabled Gas Prediction and Transaction in Smart City, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 8, 8, pp. 6305-6312, (2021); undefined, (2014); Kuthadi, Venu Madhav, Optimized Energy Management Model on Data Distributing Framework of Wireless Sensor Network in IoT System, Wireless Personal Communications, 127, 2, pp. 1377-1403, (2022); undefined, (2021); Le, Ngoc Tuyen, Automatic defect inspection for coated eyeglass based on symmetrized energy analysis of color channels, Symmetry, 11, 12, (2019); Gunasekaran, M., Machine Learning Based Big Data Processing Framework for Cancer Diagnosis Using Hidden Markov Model and GM Clustering, Wireless Personal Communications, 102, 3, pp. 2099-2116, (2018); Zhang, Ronggang, Fuzzy efficient energy smart home management system for renewable energy resources, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 8, (2020); Zhang, Yi, An intelligent transaction model for energy blockchain based on diversity of subjects, Alexandria Engineering Journal, 60, 1, pp. 749-756, (2021); Dai, Yueyue, Blockchain and Deep Reinforcement Learning Empowered Intelligent 5G beyond, IEEE Network, 33, 3, pp. 10-17, (2019); Ma, You, A highly accurate prediction algorithm for unknown web service QoS values, IEEE Transactions on Services Computing, 9, 4, pp. 511-523, (2016)","","Ain Shams University","","","","","","20904479","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189070501"

It is concerning that financial regulators and practitioners still consider the industry to be seriously fragile in several respects, particularly to operational risks and risks associated with digital transformation and innovation—not that the risks of organizational misconduct have disappeared. The rescue of Credit Suisse in 2023 confirms this. This paper employs extant theories of organizational culture, learning, and action to critically evaluate the existing risk paradigm in banking and to highlight its deficiencies, which practitioners can only address by questioning the flawed assumptions and dysfunctional values and behaviors found to be endemic in banks. However, business and risk practitioners are also married to institutional approaches that focus on assessing risk and measuring historical losses to allocate regulatory capital, rather than forward-looking approaches to measure and manage risk. This requires a paradigm change. This paper presents a novel risk measurement and accounting methodology, Risk Accounting, to help underpin such change. Risk accounting measures risk exposure in quantitative and qualitative terms and can be implemented using an AI-enabled digital architecture that could solve endemic problems with risk data aggregation and analysis. Significantly, risk accounting enables a financial value to be placed on risk exposures at a granular level. This level of transparency provides an incentive to change behaviors in banks and support cultural change while providing a basis for a paradigm change in the way operational risk is managed. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Data Fabric; Financial Institutions; Operational Risk; Organizational Culture; Risk Accounting; Risk Culture; Risk Assessment; Risk Management; Risk Perception; Data Fabric; Digital Transformation; Financial Industry; Financial Institution; Operational Risks; Organizational Cultures; Risk Accounting; Risk Cultures; Risk Exposure; Root Cause; Finance; Artificial Intelligence; Banking; Business Development; Cultural Change; Implementation Process; Institutional Framework; Organizational Change; Transformation; Article; Data Aggregation; Female; Human; Incentive; Learning; Male; Married Person; Organizational Culture; Physician; Quantitative Analysis; Risk Assessment","Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Data fabric; Digital transformation; Financial industry; Financial institution; Operational risks; Organizational cultures; Risk accounting; Risk cultures; Risk exposure; Root cause; Finance; artificial intelligence; banking; business development; cultural change; implementation process; institutional framework; organizational change; transformation; article; data aggregation; female; human; incentive; learning; male; married person; organizational culture; physician; quantitative analysis; risk assessment","","","Funding text 1: This research was supported by Enterprise Ireland Technology Centre and Commercialisation Fund grants, TC-2012-0009, \u201CGovernance Risk and Compliance Technology Centre (GRCTC),\u201D CF-2017-0672-P, \u201CMaking Laws and Regulations Smart using RegTech (SmaRT)\u201D and CF-2018-1001-I, \u201CSmaRT4Reg.\u201D Open access funding provided by IReL.; Funding text 2: This research was supported by Enterprise Ireland Technology Centre and Commercialisation Fund grants, TC\u20102012\u20100009, \u201CGovernance Risk and Compliance Technology Centre (GRCTC),\u201D CF\u20102017\u20100672\u2010P, \u201CMaking Laws and Regulations Smart using RegTech (SmaRT)\u201D and CF\u20102018\u20101001\u2010I, \u201CSmaRT4Reg.\u201D","Abdymomunov, Azamat, U.S. Banking Sector Operational Losses and the Macroeconomic Environment, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 52, 1, pp. 115-144, (2020); Coming to Terms with Operational Risk, (2019); Agnese, Paolo, The culture of risk governance in financial institutions, Journal of Risk Management in Financial Institutions, 14, 3, pp. 301-313, (2021); Operational and Cyber Risks in the Financial Sector, (2020); Almandoz, Juan (“John”), Founding Teams as Carriers of Competing Logics: When Institutional Forces Predict Banks' Risk Exposure, Administrative Science Quarterly, 59, 3, pp. 442-473, (2014); Andersen, Lasse Berg, The financial crisis in an operational risk management context - A review of causes and influencing factors, Reliability Engineering and System Safety, 105, pp. 3-12, (2012); Journal of Risk Management in Financial Institutions, (2016); Antoniades, Andreas, Financial Crises, Environment and Transition, Sustainable Development Goals Series, Part F2701, pp. 25-43, (2022); Administrative Science Quarterly, (1976); Organizational Learning A Theory of Action Perspective, (1978)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","15396924; 02724332","","RIAND","37882723","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174835961"

The overall Central Bank Digital Currency Project Index (CBDCPI) was selected as a target variable, while two machine learning algorithms, Random Forest and XGBoost were utilized to identify the determining variables. These algorithms were chosen for their ability to handle high-dimensional data and provide feature importance scores, which were crucial in identifying the most significant factors. The models were trained and validated using a rigorous cross-validation process to ensure robustness. The accuracy achieved through the Random Forest was 83%, and subsequently, 80% in XGBoost. This study explored a new research frontier by creating two machine-learning models that treated retail and wholesale CBDCPI as target variables. The data used in the process are gathered from various official sources such as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank. The Circulation of Cash, Prevalence of Cryptocurrencies, Effect of CBDC on International Trade, the Search Interest, Financial Development Index, Innovation Value, and Trade Openness are some of the most critical factors determining whether CBDC will be issued in Malaysia. Generally, are identified as important factors determining whether CBDC will be issued in Malaysia. Eventually, the factors identified will be used to develop a framework for the implementation of CBDC in Malaysia. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank Digital Currency; Framework; Machine Learning; Random Forest; Xgboost","","","","This research was funded by the IIUM-UiTM-UMP Grant, Grant ID: SRCG20-050-0050.","Cnbc, (2023); IMF Elibrary, (2023); Design Choices for Central Bank Digital Currency Policy and Technical Considerations, (2020); Tiered Cbdc and the Financial System, (2020); Rise of the Central Bank Digital Currencies Drivers Approaches and Technologies, (2020); Lee, David Kuo Chuen, A global perspective on central bank digital currency, China Economic Journal, 14, 1, pp. 52-66, (2021); Keister, Todd, Should Central Banks Issue Digital Currency?, Review of Economic Studies, 90, 1, pp. 404-431, (2023); Digitalization of Money, (2019); Brunnermeier, Markus K., On the equivalence of private and public money, Journal of Monetary Economics, 106, pp. 27-41, (2019); Reserves for all Central Bank Digital Currency Deposits and their Non Equivalence, (2018)","","Bright Publisher","","","","","","27236471","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197373855"

Since Fintech can provide the same services as traditional banks but entirely online, it is a competitor. As a result, consumers’ relationships with banking have inevitably changed, and it is therefore relevant to analyze these changes. The main objective of this study is to understand people’s perceptions of Fintech, their level of knowledge about it, and the impact of its emergence on traditional banking. The study sample consisted of 174 participants. A quantitative methodology was used to test the hypotheses formulated. The results show that participants who know about Fintech and perceive it as safe have a greater intention of changing banks. On the other hand, they perceive that supervision and regulation in traditional banks is higher than in Fintech. Among the reasons for becoming a Fintech customer, the most mentioned were lower costs and the fact that they provide greater convenience and ease of use. It will be in Fintech’s interest to continue working with regulators so that the sector makes progress in this area and consumers can recognize greater equality between traditional banks and Fintech in the future. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Banking; Consumers; Finance; Financial Innovation; Fintech","","","","","Abu Daqar, Mohannad A.M., Fintech in the eyes of Millennials and Generation Z (the financial behavior and Fintech perception), Banks and Bank Systems, 15, 3, pp. 20-28, (2020); No Poupar Esta O Ganho Saiba Como Os Seus Filhos Podem Aprender A Gerir O Dinheiro Desde Cedo Sic Noticias, (2024); Anshari, Muhammad, Factors influencing individual in adopting eWallet, Journal of Financial Services Marketing, 26, 1, pp. 10-23, (2021); Boot, Arnoud W.

For the purpose of accurate control of credit risks, banking systems seek developing financial information portfolios upon their customers using sophisticated models which are not only restricted to collecting information on borrower’s characteristics, but also, provide visibility on their respective default risk. This paper introduces a novel deep learning model to forecast the credit risk of company customers in banking systems. In particular, we develop a hybrid SVM-LSTM based neural network that predicts the total turnover of a company given the historical data records of its economic and financial features within specific periods. Through an empirical investigation based on data of 13 Tunisian manufacturing and service companies, we show that our proposed model results in more accurate statistical performances compared to the standard LSTM and to the linear regression that is commonly used in the area of credit risk management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Credit Risk Management; Deep Learning; Forecasting; Lstm; Svm; Time Series","","","","","Ben Abdesslem, Rim, Is managerial ability a moderator?

The introduction of this service may lead to increased efficiency of banks, improved quality of customer service, and a strengthened image of banks as innovative institutions. Robo-advisory uses data relating to customers, their behaviors and preferences obtained by banks from various communication channels. In the research carried out in the work, an attempt was made to obtain an answer to the question whether the data collected by banks can also be used to determine the degree of consumer interest in this type of service. This is important because the identification of customers interested in the service will allow banks to direct a properly prepared message to a selected group of addressees, increasing the effectiveness of their promotional activities. The aim of the article is to construct and examine the effectiveness of predictive models of consumer acceptance of robo-advisory services provided by banks. Based on the authors’ survey on the use of artificial intelligence technology in the banking sector in Poland, in this article we construct tree-based models to predict customers’ attitudes towards using robo-advisory in banking services using, as predictors, their socio-demographic characteristics, behaviours and attitudes towards modern digital technologies, experience in using banking services, as well as trust towards banks. In our study, we use selected machine learning algorithms, including a decision tree and several tree-based ensemble models.

Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) methods address this challenge by generating pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, assuming that all classes present in the unlabeled dataset are also represented in the labeled data. However, real-world scenarios may lead to a mixture of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples and in-distribution (ID) samples within the unlabeled dataset. In this paper, we extensively explore techniques for conducting SSOD directly on uncurated unlabeled data, termed Open-Set Semi-Supervised Object Detection (OSSOD). Our approach begins by utilizing labeled in-distribution data to dynamically construct a class-wise feature bank (CFB) that captures features specific to each class. Subsequently, we compare the features of predicted object bounding boxes with the corresponding entries in the CFB to calculate OOD scores. We design an adaptive threshold based on the statistical properties of the CFB to accommodate different classes, allowing us to effectively filter out OOD samples. The effectiveness of our proposed method is substantiated through extensive experiments on two widely used remote sensing object detection datasets: DIOR and DOTA. These experiments demonstrate the superior performance and efficacy of our OSSOD approach on RSIs.

It is an assessment of the bank’s financial health, stability and capacity to manage risks. This paper aims to investigate the credit rating patterns that are crucial for assessing creditworthiness of the Islamic banks, thereby evaluating the stability of their industry. Design/methodology/approach: Three distinct machine learning algorithms are exploited and evaluated for the desired objective. This research initially uses the decision tree machine learning algorithm as a base learner conducting an in-depth comparison with the ensemble decision tree and Random Forest. Subsequently, the Apriori algorithm is deployed to uncover the most significant attributes impacting a bank’s credit rating. To appraise the previously elucidated models, a ten-fold cross-validation method is applied. This method involves segmenting the data sets into ten folds, with nine used for training and one for testing alternatively ten times changeable. This approach aims to mitigate any potential biases that could arise during the learning and training phases. Following this process, the accuracy is assessed and depicted in a confusion matrix as outlined in the methodology section. Findings: The findings of this investigation reveal that the Random Forest machine learning algorithm superperforms others, achieving an impressive 90.5% accuracy in predicting credit ratings. Notably, our research sheds light on the significance of the loan-to-deposit ratio as a primary attribute affecting credit rating predictions. Moreover, this study uncovers additional pivotal banking features that intensely impact the measurements under study. This paper’s findings provide evidence that the loan-to-deposit ratio looks to be the purest bank attribute that affects credit rating prediction. In addition, deposit-to-assets ratio and profit sharing investment account ratio criteria are found to be effective in credit rating prediction and the ownership structure criterion came to be viewed as one of the essential bank attributes in credit rating prediction.

However, e-banking adoption rates may vary between groups and evolve as awareness and trust in the service increases. Customers perceive products and services differently based on their experiences, beliefs, and values. Their attitudes toward a brand or product influence their decision to buy or continue using it. Therefore, Machine Learning Development can be used by businesses to analyze customer behavior through market research, surveys, and data analytics to gain insights that can inform product development, marketing strategies, and customer relationship management efforts. Knowing customer behavior allows banks to provide a more personalized user experience. This may include presenting product recommendations or providing notifications that match customer preferences. The classification results of the best-selected technique, with an accuracy rate of 98.61% and an execution time of 10 seconds, can be used as a reference to determine customer behavior in important e-banking transactions because they significantly impact business strategy and development of digital banking services. Customer behavior data is a valuable source of information that can be used to make strategic decisions. For example, some services are often used, namely bill payment and QRIS. So, the Bank can use data analysis to design more effective marketing campaigns, optimize operational processes, and design new products that suit customer needs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classification Technique; Customer Behavior; Decision Tree; E-banking Transaction; Machine Learning","","","","","Anwar, Cep Jandi, Investigating the relationship between monetary policy, macro-prudential policy and credit risk in Indonesia banking industry, Heliyon, 9, 7, (2023); Aicos Asian Journal of Islamic Economic Studies, (2024); Firmansyah, Irfan Achmad, The influence of efficacy, credibility, and normative pressure to M-banking adoption level in Indonesia, Procedia Computer Science, 197, pp. 51-60, (2021); Kasri, Rahmatina Awaliah, Digital payment and banking stability in emerging economy with dual banking system, Heliyon, 8, 11, (2022); Abdennebi, Hela Ben, M-banking adoption from the developing countries perspective: A mediated model, Digital Business, 3, 2, (2023); Rahman, Md Hasanur, Green banking initiatives and sustainability: A comparative analysis between Bangladesh and India, Research in Globalization, 7, (2023); Wijayaningtyas, Maranatha, The effect of economical phenomenon on informal construction workers earnings within Covid-19 pandemic: A mixed method analysis, Heliyon, 8, 8, (2022); Rahman, Mahfuzur, An Empirical Analysis of Cashless Payment Systems for Business Transactions, Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity, 8, 4, (2022); Chen, Xia, Factors affecting cryptocurrency adoption in digital business transactions: The mediating role of customer satisfaction, Technology in Society, 70, (2022); Schmuck, Roland, The use of online business models, Procedia Manufacturing, 54, pp. 45-51, (2020)","","Little Lion Scientific","","","","","","19928645; 18173195","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190610410"

To date, there is ambiguity about whether it is possible to grant virtual legal personality to AI systems. Methodology: The researcher used the analytical method to understand the mechanisms of AI applied in banking operations, assess the effectiveness of these applications, and analyze the legal texts. Additionally, the inductive method was employed to fit the uses of AI in the banking sector. Results: The main findings of the study can be summarized as follows: The possibility of assigning civil liability to AI entities for errors they commit is applicable only in one case, which is when the AI banking system is the tool causing the damage. Conclusion: The study concludes that there is a need to amend certain legal texts in the Transactions Law. The study suggests that the Omani Civil Transactions Law of 2013 should be updated to align with the nature of AI in banking. This includes developing general legal rules related to the responsibility of employers for the actions of their employees and the custody of objects, ensuring they fit the specific errors of AI in banking.

Against this backdrop, the present study endeavors to predict potential banking crises in India by leveraging a spectrum of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques (AI-ML). These techniques encompass logistic regression, random forest, naïve Bayes, gradient boosting, support vector machine, neural networks, K-nearest neighbors, and decision trees. Initially, a banking fragility index was constructed utilizing monthly banking data spanning 2002 to 2023, demarcating the periods of crisis and stability. Subsequently, an extensive array of early warning indicators (EWIs) encompassing asset prices, macroeconomic factors, external influences, and credit-related variables were employed to forecast crisis periods. Our findings reveal that AI-ML models exhibit reasonable accuracy in predicting banking crises. Moreover, advanced model performance metrics highlight neural networks and random forest models as particularly effective in crisis prediction, surpassing other methodologies. Notably, among the EWIs, variables related to credit, interest rates, and liquidity emerge as possessing relatively higher information value in discerning fragilities within the Indian banking system. Importantly, the methodological framework presented herein can be extrapolated for banking crisis prediction in other economies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Bank Fragility; Banking Crisis; Early Warning Indicators; Information Value; Machine Learning; Neural Network; Random Forest","","","","","International Journal of Business and Administrative Studies, (2015); Akkoç, Soner, An empirical comparison of conventional techniques, neural networks and the three stage hybrid Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model for credit scoring analysis: The case of Turkish credit card data, European Journal of Operational Research, 222, 1, pp. 168-178, (2012); Bis Quarterly Review, (2018); Alessi, Lucia, Quasi real time early warning indicators for costly asset price boom/bust cycles: A role for global liquidity, European Journal of Political Economy, 27, 3, pp. 520-533, (2011); Allen, Franklin, Financial fragility, liquidity, and asset prices, Journal of the European Economic Association, 2, 6, pp. 1015-1048, (2004); Antunes, António A., Forecasting banking crises with dynamic panel probit models, International Journal of Forecasting, 34, 2, pp. 249-275, (2018); Ari, Ali, The Twin Crises: Determinants of Banking and Currency Crises in the Turkish Economy, Emerging Markets Finance and Trade, 52, 1, pp. 123-135, (2016); Babecký, Jan, Banking, debt, and currency crises in developed countries: Stylized facts and early warning indicators, Journal of Financial Stability, 15, pp. 1-17, (2014); Journal of Information Engineering and Applications, (2013); Beutel, Johannes, Does machine learning help us predict banking crises?, Journal of Financial Stability, 45, (2019)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","19118074","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191237699"

In the current banking industry, mobile banking software, sometimes known as apps, has largely replaced traditional branch banking services. Consumers’ banking experiences can be greatly enhanced, and bank processes can be simplified, with the advent of mobile banking via apps. Customers’ satisfaction with mobile banking apps has been an important issue in recent research. In addition, the assessment of mobile apps in online banking has gained significant popularity. There have been several studies on customers’ satisfaction with online banking; however, this issue is not widely investigated by machine learning techniques. Specifically, there is no study to investigate customers’ satisfaction with mobile banking apps and evaluate them using a comprehensive set of factors using predictive text mining and machine learning techniques. In this study, we develop a hybrid method using text mining and regression machine learning approaches to evaluate the factors impacting customers’ satisfaction with online banking apps in Saudi Arabia. The factors are discovered from users generated content (UGC) in mobile banking apps using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). The customers’ satisfaction is predicted using support vector regression (SVR) and principal component analysis (PCA). The results show that machine learning can be an effective approach to assessing customers’ satisfaction with online banking apps using the factors discovered by text mining from UGC. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Customers Satisfaction; Machine Learning; Mobile Apps; Online Banking; Text Mining; Customer Satisfaction; Data Mining; E-learning; Learning Algorithms; Principal Component Analysis; Sales; Statistics; Customers' Satisfaction; Hybrid Approach; Machine Learning Techniques; Machine-learning; Mobile App; Mobile Bankings; On-line Banking; Saudi Arabia; Text-mining; User-generated; Machine Learning","Customer satisfaction; Data mining; E-learning; Learning algorithms; Principal component analysis; Sales; Statistics; Customers' satisfaction; Hybrid approach; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Mobile app; Mobile bankings; On-line banking; Saudi Arabia; Text-mining; User-generated; Machine learning","","","The authors are thankful to the Deanship of Scientific Research at Najran University for funding this work, under the General Research Funding program Grant code (NU/DRP/SERC/12/40).","Chetioui, Youssef, Mobile banking usage in the postpandemic era: Demystifying the disparities among divergent user segments in a majority-Muslim country, Journal of Islamic Marketing, 14, 12, pp. 3053-3084, (2023); J Sci Technol Policy Manag, (2023); Digital Economy and the Information Society Technologies for Modern Digital Entrepreneurship, (2020); Zheng, Guangwen, The effect of Fintech adoption on green finance and environmental performance of banking institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic: the role of green innovation, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 30, 10, pp. 25959-25971, (2023); Silanoi, Wischaya, The Confidence of and Concern about Using Mobile Banking among Generation Z: A Case of the Post COVID-19 Situation in Thailand, Social Sciences, 12, 4, (2023); Sharma, Manisha, Role of social media on mobile banking adoption among consumers, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 180, (2022); Nikou, Shahrokh, Mobile technology and forgotten consumers: The young-elderly, International Journal of Consumer Studies, 39, 4, pp. 294-304, (2015); Asian Social Science, (2018); Gilbert, Peter, Vision: Automated security validation of mobile apps at app markets, pp. 21-25, (2011); Muñoz-Leiva, Francisco, Determinants of intention to use the mobile banking apps: An extension of the classic TAM model, Spanish Journal of Marketing - ESIC, 21, 1, pp. 25-38, (2017)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","14333058; 09410643","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182437386"

Indeed, in the light of the recent digital transition of services, they aim to leverage digital channels to deliver basic services and reduce the number of physical facilities to dedicate to more complex and added-value operations. In order to implement the new business model, banking groups are shrinking their internal branch networks and outsourcing basic services to maintain physical proximity to customers unwilling to adopt digital channels. This work aims to formulate a mathematical programming model to support the decision-making process concerning the branch network restructuring. The model is formulated as a hierarchical covering location problem. Three types of branches providing different categories of services are considered. They are organized according to a three-level hierarchical structure, and each level is associated with a covering radius, representing the related accessibility condition to be guaranteed to users. A further category of facilities is considered, namely external facilities, that may support internal ones in providing basic banking services. The objective is to identify the network structure able to serve all the demand for banking services and minimize the total costs. A specific parameter is introduced to regulate the maximum outsourcing level that the bank is willing to achieve. The model is tested by considering a real case study concerning one of the main banking groups in Italy. The obtained results show the capability of the model to provide interesting scenarios and fruitful managerial implications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking Sector; Decision Support System; Digital Transition; Facility Location; Hierarchical Covering; Outsourcing; Artificial Intelligence; Decision Making; Mathematical Programming; Outsourcing; Banking Sectors; Banking Services; Channel Distributions; Complex Values; Digital Channel; Digital Transition; Facilities Locations; Hierarchical Covering; Multi Channel; Network Restructuring; Decision Support Systems","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Mathematical programming; Outsourcing; Banking sectors; Banking services; Channel distributions; Complex values; Digital channel; Digital transition; Facilities locations; Hierarchical covering; Multi channel; Network restructuring; Decision support systems","","","","Aldajani, Mansour A., Location of banking automatic teller machines based on convolution, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 57, 4, pp. 1194-1201, (2009); Base Dati Statistica, (2022); Başar, Ayfer, A Decision Support Methodology for Locating Bank Branches: A Case Study in Turkey, International Journal of Information Technology and Decision Making, 16, 1, pp. 59-86, (2017); Berger, Allen N., The consolidation of the financial services industry: Causes, consequences, and implications for the future, Journal of Banking and Finance, 23, 2, pp. 135-194, (1999); Berman, Oded, Cooperative cover location problems: The planar case, IIE Transactions (Institute of Industrial Engineers), 42, 3, pp. 232-246, (2010); Bruno, Giuseppe, Reorganizing postal collection operations in urban areas as a result of declining mail volumes–A case study in Bologna, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 72, 7, pp. 1591-1606, (2021); Bruno, Giuseppe, A reduced Composite Indicator for Digital Divide measurement at the regional level: An application to the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI), Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 190, (2023); Bruno, Giuseppe, Capacity management in public service facility networks: a model, computational tests and a case study, Optimization Letters, 10, 5, pp. 975-995, (2016); Byers, Reynold E., ATM pricing and location games in the retail banking industry, Asia-Pacific Journal of Operational Research, 29, 1, (2012); Turkoglu, Derya Celik, A comparative survey of service facility location problems, Annals of Operations Research, 292, 1, pp. 399-468, (2020)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09574174","","ESAPE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175247542"

This paper proposes a novel approach that uses unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify significant features needed to assess and differentiate between different forms of risk culture. Design/methodology/approach: To convert the unstructured text in our sample of banks' 10K reports into structured data, a two-dimensional dictionary for text mining is built to capture risk culture characteristics and the bank's attitude towards the risk culture characteristics. A principal component analysis (PCA) reduction technique is applied to extract the significant features that define risk culture, before using a K-means unsupervised learning to cluster the reports into distinct risk culture groups. Findings: The PCA identifies uncertainty, litigious and constraining sentiments among risk culture features to be significant in defining the risk culture of banks. Cluster analysis on the PCA factors proposes three distinct risk culture clusters: good, fair and poor. Consistent with regulatory expectations, a good or fair risk culture in banks is characterized by high profitability ratios, bank stability, lower default risk and good governance. Originality/value: The relationship between culture and risk management can be difficult to study given that it is hard to measure culture from traditional data sources that are messy and diverse. This study offers a better understanding of risk culture using an unsupervised machine learning approach. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cluster Analysis; Machine Learning; Risk Culture; Text Mining","","","","1. “A preprint version of this paper appeared as “Identifying the Risk Culture of Banks Using Machine Learning” and has been posted on SSRN repository”. 2. “A preprint version of this paper appeared as “Identifying the Risk Culture of Banks Using Machine Learning” and has been posted on ResearchGate repository”.

This paper aims to evaluate the social sustainability of banks by constructing a new interval-based composite indicator using the Thomson Reuters database. In this paper, to measure the social sustainability of European banks, we propose an approach to construct interval-based composite indicators that usefully extends the construction of the composite indicator and allows us to measure the uncertainty generated by the choices made in the construction of the composite indicator. The methodological approach is based on Monte Carlo simulation and allows us to improve the information provided by the composite indicators. Thus, we measure the value of the social indicator and its subcomponents and the uncertainty of the value due to the different possible weightings. The results show that the best international ESG practices in European banks are found in French and British banks, especially in Italian ones. Finally, we analyze innovative perspectives and propose policy recommendations to support sustainable banking ecosystems in light of the increasing attention to ESG indicator disclosure and its correspondence to reality. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Esg; Interval-based Composite Indicators; Machine Learning; Monte-carlo Simulation; Social Index; Sustainable Banking; Intelligent Systems; Monte Carlo Methods; Sustainable Development; Composite Indicators; Esg; Interval-based Composite Indicator; Machine-learning; Monte Carlo's Simulation; Social Index; Social Information; Social Sustainability; Sustainable Banking; Uncertainty; Machine Learning; Banking; Composite; Machine Learning; Monte Carlo Analysis; Social Indicator; Socioeconomic Indicator; Sustainability","Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Sustainable development; Composite indicators; ESG; Interval-based composite indicator; Machine-learning; Monte Carlo's simulation; Social index; Social information; Social sustainability; Sustainable banking; Uncertainty; Machine learning; banking; composite; machine learning; Monte Carlo analysis; social indicator; socioeconomic indicator; sustainability","","","","Adu, Douglas Akwasi, Executive compensation, environmental performance, and sustainable banking: The moderating effect of governance mechanisms, Business Strategy and the Environment, 31, 4, pp. 1439-1463, (2022); Adv J Financ Innovat Report, (2023); Ahmad, Nisar, Revisiting the impact of ESG on financial performance of FTSE350 UK firms: Static and dynamic panel data analysis, Cogent Business and Management, 8, 1, (2021); Viii International Meeting on Quantitative Methods for Applied Sciences, (2006); Quality Quantity, (2023); Ashwin Kumar, N.

Therefore, customer retention is essential in today's extremely competitive banking market. Additionally, having a solid customer base helps attract new consumers by fostering confidence and a referral from a current clientele. These factors make reducing client attrition a crucial step that banks must pursue. In our research, we aim to examine bank data and forecast which users will most likely discontinue using the bank's services and become paying customers. We use various machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and show comparative analysis on different evaluation metrics. In addition, we developed a Data Visualization RShiny app for data science and management regarding customer churn analysis. Analyzing this data will help the bank indicate the trend and then try to retain customers on the verge of attrition. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank Customer Attrition; Churn Prediction; Machine Learning; Random Forest; Xg Boost; Data Science; Data Visualization; E-learning; Learning Algorithms; Sales; Visualization; Bank Customer Attrition; Banking Industry; Churn Predictions; Customer Churns; Customer Retention; Good And Services; Machine Learning Approaches; Machine-learning; Random Forests; Xg Boost; Machine Learning","Data Science; Data visualization; E-learning; Learning algorithms; Sales; Visualization; Bank customer attrition; Banking industry; Churn predictions; Customer churns; Customer retention; Good and services; Machine learning approaches; Machine-learning; Random forests; XG boost; Machine learning","","","","Al-Mashraie, Mohammed, Customer switching behavior analysis in the telecommunication industry via push-pull-mooring framework: A machine learning approach, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 144, (2020); Customers Churn Prediction in Financial Institution Using Artificial Neural Network, (2019); Duque Anton, Simon, Anomaly-based intrusion detection in industrial data with SVM and random forests, (2019); Baghla, Seema, Performance Evaluation of Various Classification Techniques for Customer Churn Prediction in E-commerce, Microprocessors and Microsystems, 94, (2022); Cervantes, Jair Cervantes, A comprehensive survey on support vector machine classification: Applications, challenges and trends, Neurocomputing, 408, pp. 189-215, (2020); Chawla, Nitesh Vinay, SMOTE: Synthetic minority over-sampling technique, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 16, pp. 321-357, (2002); Chen, Tianqi, XGBoost: A scalable tree boosting system, 13-17-August-2016, pp. 785-794, (2016); de Caigny, Arno, Incorporating textual information in customer churn prediction models based on a convolutional neural network, International Journal of Forecasting, 36, 4, pp. 1563-1578, (2020); de Lima Lemos, Renato Alexandre, Propension to customer churn in a financial institution: a machine learning approach, Neural Computing and Applications, 34, 14, pp. 11751-11768, (2022); Dias, Joana Matos, Machine learning for customer churn prediction in retail banking, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 12251 LNCS, pp. 576-589, (2020)","","KeAi Communications Co.","","","","","","26667649","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181666198"

When the studies are examined, it is seen that many methods are used for this purpose. Traditional machine learning methods are widely used in loss analysis due to their ability to process large amounts of customer data. In this study, the classification of the customer group in the banking sector has been made. In the context of the banking sector, this study delved into the classification of customer groups, utilizing a dataset and various machine learning models. Since the imbalance in the data set negatively affects the success parameters, the imbalance of the data is also discussed in this study.

Within its institutions, continuous criteria of efficiency facilitate the evaluation of the impact of the reforms and policies on the banks' performance. In this paper, we employ the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) method for estimating the efficiency of Islamic banks in developed and developing countries. MARS is a well-known efficient method for the flexible modelling of high-dimensional data. Unlike previous work, using a nonparametric technique of such a robustness instead of parametric approaches contributes to the improvement of the various estimates, which provides investors with accurate and timely information they can immediately react upon for a better decision-making in turbulent times. On the one hand, the results of the experiments show that, in the emerging region, there is evidence of a strong linkage between Islamic banking efficiency and gross domestic product. On the other hand, in the developed region, the efficiency is rather based upon Sharia Supervisory Board and board committees. These outcomes confirm previous works showing that governance-related variables have a significant positive effect on Islamic banking efficiency. Furthermore, the overall MARS-based predictions reveal that Islamic banks operating in developed countries are relatively more efficient than their counterparts in emerging countries. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","C23; Data-mining; Efficiency; G21; G3; Governance; Islamic Banking; Machine Learning; Subprime Crisis","","","","The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by a grant from the Singapore Ministry of Education (grant no.

By comparing different predictive models (traditional statistical and machine learning algorithms), this study aims to examine the macroeconomic determinants’ impact on the UK banking credit risk and assess the most accurate credit risk estimate using predictive analytics. This study found that the variance-based multi-split decision tree algorithm is the most precise predictive model with interpretable, reliable, and robust results. Our model performance achieved 95% accuracy and evidenced that unemployment and inflation rate are significant credit risk predictors in the UK banking context. Our findings provided valuable insights such as a positive association between credit risk and inflation, the unemployment rate, and national savings, as well as a negative relationship between credit risk and national debt, total trade deficit, and national income. In addition, we empirically showed the relationship between national savings and non-performing loans, thus proving the “paradox of thrift”.

However, as they are generally run by charitable organisations that are chronically short of human and other resources, their inbound logistics efforts commonly experience difficulties in two key areas: 1) how to organise stocks of donated food, and 2) how to assess the donated items quality and fitness for purpose. To address both these problems, the authors aimed to develop a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach to food quality and warehousing management in food banks. Design/methodology/approach: For diagnosing the quality of donated food items, the authors designed a convolutional neural network (CNN); and to ascertain how best to arrange such items within food banks' available space, reinforcement learning was used. Findings: Testing of the proposed innovative CNN demonstrated its ability to provide consistent, accurate assessments of the quality of five species of donated fruit. The reinforcement-learning approach, as well as being capable of devising effective storage schemes for donated food, required fewer computational resources that some other approaches that have been proposed. Research limitations/implications: Viewed through the lens of expectation-confirmation theory, which the authors found useful as a framework for research of this kind, the proposed AI-based inbound-logistics techniques exceeded normal expectations and achieved positive disconfirmation. Practical implications: As well as enabling machines to learn how inbound logistics are handed by human operators, this pioneering study showed that such machines could achieve excellent performance: i.e., that the consistency provided by AI operations could in future dramatically enhance such logistics' quality, in the specific case of food banks. Originality/value: This paper’s AI-based inbound-logistics approach differs considerably from others, and was found able to effectively manage both food-quality assessments and food-storage decisions more rapidly than its counterparts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Food Banks; Inbound Logistics; Quality Management; Warehousing Management","","","","This research was supported in part by Feng Chia University, Taiwan (Grant No. 23H00807) and National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan (Grants MOST 110-2410-H-035-027 and MOST 111-2410-H-035-025).

The use of these technologies is accelerating in various industries, including banking. However, the literature on banking is scattered, making a global understanding difficult. This study reviewed the main approaches in terms of applications and algorithmic models, as well as the benefits and challenges associated with their implementation in banking, in addition to a bibliometric analysis of variables related to the distribution of publications and the most productive countries, as well as an analysis of the co-occurrence and dynamics of keywords. Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) framework, forty articles were selected for review. The results indicate that these technologies are used in the banking sector for customer segmentation, credit risk analysis, recommendation, and fraud detection. It should be noted that credit analysis and fraud detection are the most implemented areas, using algorithms such as random forests (RF), decision trees (DT), support vector machines (SVM), and logistic regression (LR), among others. In addition, their use brings significant benefits for decision-making and optimizing banking operations.

Design/methodology/approach: The study makes use of the Tobias and Brunnermeier (2016) estimator to quantify the systemic risk (ΔCoVaR) that banks contribute to the system. The methodology addresses a classification problem based on the probability that a particular bank will emit high systemic risk or moderate systemic risk. The study applies machine learning models such as logistic regression, random forest (RF), neural networks and gradient boosting machine (GBM) and addresses the issue of imbalanced data sets to investigate bank’s balance sheet features and bank’s stock features which may potentially determine the factors of systemic risk emission. Findings: The study reports that across various performance matrices, the authors find that two specifications are preferred: RF and GBM. The study identifies lag of the estimator of systemic risk, stock beta, stock volatility and return on equity as important features to explain emission of systemic risk. Practical implications: The findings will help banks and regulators with the key features that can be used to formulate the policy decisions. Originality/value: This study contributes to the existing literature by suggesting classification algorithms that can be used to model the probability of systemic risk emission in a classification problem setting. Further, the study identifies the features responsible for the likelihood of systemic risk. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banks; Classification Problem; Emerging Economy; Machine Learning; Systemic Risk","","","","Availability of data and materials : The data sets such as variable importance generated during and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.","Acharya, Viral V., A theory of systemic risk and design of prudential bank regulation, Journal of Financial Stability, 5, 3, pp. 224-255, (2009); Acharya, Viral V., Capital shortfall: A new approach to ranking and regulating systemic risks, American Economic Review, 102, 3, pp. 59-64, (2012); Ahmed, Shamima, Artificial intelligence and machine learning in finance: A bibliometric review, Research in International Business and Finance, 61, (2022); Akhtaruzzaman, Md, Financial contagion during COVID–19 crisis, Finance Research Letters, 38, (2021); Akhtaruzzaman, Md, Systemic risk-sharing framework of cryptocurrencies in the COVID–19 crisis, Finance Research Letters, 47, (2022); Hamed Al-Yahyaee, Khamis Hamed, Is there a systemic risk between Sharia, Sukuk, and GCC stock markets?

To reduce the risk of investment and to predict price, trend, portfolio construction, and fraud detection some Artificial Intelligence techniques are required. The Paper discusses recent research in the field of AI techniques for cryptocurrency and Bitcoin which is the most popular cryptocurrency. AI and ML techniques such as SVM, ANN, LSTM, GRU, and much other related research work with cryptocurrency and Bitcoin have been reviewed and most relevant studies are discussed in the paper. Also highlighted some possible research opportunities and areas for better efficiency of the results. Recently in the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity have advanced expeditiously. Its implementation has been extensively useful in finance as well as has a crucial impact on markets, institutions, and legislation. It is making the world a better place. AI is responsible for the simulation of machines that are replicas of human beings and are intelligent enough. AI in finance is changing the way we communicate with money. It helps the financial industry streamline and optimize processes from credit judgments to quantitative analysis marketing and economic risk management. The main goal of this research has been investigating certain impacts of artificial intelligence in this contemporary world. It's centered on the appeal of artificial intelligence, confrontation, chances, and its influence on professions and careers. The research paper uses AI to enable banks to generate financial resources and to provide valuable customer services. The application of the growing Indian banking sector is part of everyday life made up of several banks like RBI, SBI, HDFC, etc. and these banks have digitally implemented using chat-bots that have brought benefits to the customers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Banking; Cybersecurity; Bitcoin; Crime; Cybersecurity; Investments; Long Short-term Memory; Risk Management; Artificial Intelligence Techniques; Banking Systems; Better Places; Cyber Security; Financial System; Fraud Detection; Price Trends; Recent Researches; Research Areas; Research Opportunities; Risk Assessment","Bitcoin; Crime; Cybersecurity; Investments; Long short-term memory; Risk management; Artificial intelligence techniques; Banking systems; Better places; Cyber security; Financial system; Fraud detection; Price trends; Recent researches; Research areas; Research opportunities; Risk assessment","","","The authors are grateful to Indus University, Nirma University, Department of Chemical Engineering, and School of Technology Pandit Deendayal Energy University for the permission to publish this research.","Hassani, Hossein, Big-crypto: Big data, blockchain and cryptocurrency, Big Data and Cognitive Computing, 2, 4, pp. 1-15, (2018); Chhajer, Parshv, The applications of artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and long–short term memory for stock market prediction, Decision Analytics Journal, 2, (2022); Optimization Based Data Mining Theory and Applications, (2011); Tien, James M., Internet of Things, Real-Time Decision Making, and Artificial Intelligence, Annals of Data Science, 4, 2, pp. 149-178, (2017); Cioffi, Raffaele, Artificial intelligence and machine learning applications in smart production: Progress, trends, and directions, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 2, (2020); Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Businesses from Research Innovation Market Deployment to Future Shifts in Business Models, (2019); International Encyclopedia of Geography People the Earth Environment and Technology, (2017); Journal of Latex Class Files, (2018); In Int Eng J Res Dev Iejrd, (2019); Artificial Intelligence, (2017)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","21985804; 21985812","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137449925"

While robo-advisory services are expected to witness lucrative growth, challenges persist in the current landscape where most consumers are unready to adopt and even resist the new service. The study aims to investigate resistance to robo-advisors through the privacy and justice perspective. The human-like attributes are modeled as the antecedents to perceived justice, followed by the subsequent outcomes of privacy concerns, perceived intrusiveness and resistance. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was conducted to gather consumer responses about their perceptions of robo-advisors. Two hundred valid questionnaires were collected and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The results revealed that (1) perceived anthropomorphism and perceived autonomy are the positive determinants of perceived justice, (2) perceived justice negatively impacts privacy concerns and perceived intrusiveness and (3) privacy concerns and perceived intrusiveness positively influence resistance to robo-advisors. Originality/value: The present study contributes to robo-advisory service research by applying a privacy and justice perspective to explain consumer resistance to robo-advisors, thereby complementing past studies that focused on the technology acceptance paradigm. The study also offers practical implications for mitigating resistance to robo-advisors. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Fintech; Justice; Privacy Concerns; Resistance; Robo-advisors","","","","","Araujo, Theo B., In AI we trust?

The paper aims to model the factors influencing bank customers’ readiness for artificially intelligent banking products within the South African banking sector. Data were collected from 346 banking customers within South Africa. The study results revealed that demographic and socio-cultural variables influence the readiness for artificially intelligent banking products. Behavioural finance biases also influence bank customers’ readiness for artificially intelligent banking products. Furthermore, the study also found that customers’ readiness for artificial intelligent banking products is faced with the limitation of the inaccessibility to technological tools in rural areas.

Our intuition behind this approach is that text could reduce bank opacity and allow us to understand better the strategic options of banking firms. We retrieve textual information from bank annual reports using a sample of 9,207 U.S. bank-year observations during the period 1994-2016. To predict bidders and targets, we use textual information along with financial variables as inputs to several machine learning models. We find that when we jointly use textual information and financial variables as inputs, the performance of our models is substantially improved compared to models using a single type of input. Furthermore, we find that the performance improvement due to the inclusion of text is more noticeable in predicting future bidders, a task which is less explored in the relevant literature. Therefore, our findings highlight the importance of textual information in a bank merger prediction task. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank Merger Prediction; Finance; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Textual Analysis; Finance; Information Use; Learning Algorithms; Machine Learning; Mergers And Acquisitions; Merging; Natural Language Processing Systems; Bank Merger Prediction; Bank Mergers; Financial Variables; Language Processing; Machine-learning; Natural Language Processing; Natural Languages; Prediction Tasks; Textual Information; Textual-analysis; Forecasting","Finance; Information use; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mergers and acquisitions; Merging; Natural language processing systems; Bank merger prediction; Bank mergers; Financial variables; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Prediction tasks; Textual information; Textual-analysis; Forecasting","","","Funding text 1: We would like to thank Emanuele Borgonovo (Co-editor-in-Chief), three anonymous referees, Ilias Chalkidis, Nikolaos Gkoumas, Prodromos Malakasiotis, Thanos Verousis, and the participants at the Annual Event of Finance Research Letters 2022 CEMLA Conference: New Advances in International Finance for their valuable comments and suggestions.

This article explores the application and use of artificial intelligence (AI) to detect and prevent money laundering in South African banking institutions. The implementation of big data technologies, data processing analytics and AI could enhance the detection and prevention of money laundering activities in South Africa's banking sector. AI should be carefully utilised to improve the detection of suspicious activities and the accuracy of financial intelligence, and to combat evolving money laundering techniques. The article also examines the benefits and challenges of implementing AI as an anti-money laundering (AML) measure in the South African banking sector. These include the need for quality data, integration with existing regulatory systems, regulatory compliance and ethical considerations. The article highlights the potential use of AI in transaction monitoring, customer due diligence, outcomes-based risk assessment and the improved detection of suspicious transactions. This could be done by utilising AI to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of AML measures. The importance of effective coordination between banking institutions, regulatory authorities and law enforcement bodies is also highlighted as a key component of leveraging AI to combat money laundering and related financial crimes in South Africa's banking sector. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Banking Institutions; Customer Due Diligence; Money Laundering","","","","","2014 Information Systems Research, (2014); Alaimo, Cristina, Computing the everyday: Social media as data platforms, Information Society, 33, 4, pp. 175-191, (2017); Intelligent Information Management, (2023); Allam, Zaheer, On big data, artificial intelligence and smart cities, Cities, 89, pp. 80-91, (2019); Private Security State Ball K Et Al the Private Security State Surveillance Consumer Data and the War on Terror, (2015); Journal of Economic and International Law Bara A and Le Roux P International Financial Centres Global Finance and Financial Development in the Southern Africa Development Community Sadc 2017 Journal of Economic and International Finance, (2017); Basdeo, Vinesh, THE LEGAL CHALLENGES OF CRIMINAL AND CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE IN SOUTH AFRICA: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS, African Journal of International and Comparative Law, 21, 3, pp. 303-326, (2013); Journal of Banking and Financial Technology, (2020); Boles, Jeffrey R., Financial Sector Executives as Targets for Money Laundering Liability, American Business Law Journal, 52, 3, pp. 365-433, (2015); Journal of Business Ethics, (2011)","","North-West Unversity","","","","","","17273781","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204706624"

This task is a challenging one, and as the demand for loans increases, so does the number of applications. Traditional methods of checking eligibility are time-consuming and laborious, and they may not always accurately identify suitable loan recipients. As a result, some applicants may default on their loans, causing financial losses for banks. Artificial Intelligence, using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques, can provide a more efficient solution. These techniques can use various classification algorithms to predict which applicants will likely be eligible for loans. This study uses five Machine Learning classification algorithms (Gaussian Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, K Neighbors Classifier, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression) and eight Deep Learning algorithms (MLP, CNN, LSTM, Transformer, GRU, Autoencoder, ResNet, and DenseNet). The use of Ensemble Methods and SMOTE with SMOTE-TOMEK Techniques also has a positive impact on the results. Four metrics are used to evaluate the effectiveness of these algorithms: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-measure. The study found that DenseNet and ResNet were the most accurate predictive models. These findings highlight the potential of predictive modeling in identifying credit disapproval among vulnerable consumers in a sea of loan applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Classification Models; Customer Loan Prediction; Data Preprocessing; Deep Learning; Machine Learning; Model Optimization; Adversarial Machine Learning; Contrastive Learning; Decentralized Finance; Deep Learning; Random Forests; Classification Algorithm; Classification Models; Customer Loan Prediction; Data Preprocessing; Ensemble Methods; Loan Default; Machine-learning; Model Optimization; Predictive Models; Prediction Models","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Decentralized finance; Deep learning; Random forests; Classification algorithm; Classification models; Customer loan prediction; Data preprocessing; Ensemble methods; Loan default; Machine-learning; Model optimization; Predictive models; Prediction models","","","This work was supported by King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, through the Researchers Supporting Project, under Grant RSP2024R244.","Journal of Computer Science and Engineering Jcse, (2022); Int J Sci Res Publ, (2021); Malhotra, Davinder Kumar, EVALUATING CONSUMER LOANS USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES, Applications of Management Science, 20, pp. 59-69, (2020); Chen, Jian, Agricultural Loan Delinquency Prediction Using Machine Learning Methods, International Food and Agribusiness Management Review, 24, 5, pp. 797-812, (2021); Zahi, Sara, Modeling car loan prepayment using supervised machine learning, Procedia Computer Science, 170, pp. 1128-1133, (2020); Ann Romanian Soc Cell Biol, (2021); Bank Loan Approval Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques, (2021); International Journal of Machine Learning and Computing, (2022); Itm Web of Conferences, (2022); Journal of Educational Technology, (2020)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211639951"

First to examine the role of the board of directors in facilitating the adoption of AI and ML in Saudi Arabian banking sector. Second, to explore the effectiveness of artificial intelligence and machine learning in protection of Saudi Arabian banking sector from cyberattacks. A qualitative research approach was applied using in-depth interviews with 17 board of directors from prominent Saudi Arabian banks. The present study highlights both the opportunities and challenges of integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning advanced technologies in this highly regulated industry. Findings reveal that advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies offer substantial benefits, particularly in areas like threat detection, fraud prevention, and process automation, enabling banks to meet regulatory standards and mitigate cyber threats efficiently. However, the research also identifies significant barriers, including limited technological infrastructure, a lack of cohesive artificial intelligence strategies, and ethical concerns around data privacy and algorithmic bias. Interviewees emphasized the board of directors’ critical role in providing strategic direction, securing resources, and fostering partnerships with artificial intelligence technology providers. The study further highlights the importance of aligning artificial intelligence and machine learning initiatives with national development goals, such as Saudi Vision 2030, to ensure sustained growth and competitiveness. The findings from the present study offer valuable implications for policymakers in banking in navigating the complexities of artificial intelligence and machine learning adoption in financial services, particularly in emerging markets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Banking Sector; Board Of Directors; Machine Learning; Saudi Arabia; Stakeholder Theory","","","","","Al-Dosari, Khalifa Youssef Mubarak, Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Defense System for Banking Industry: A Qualitative Study of AI Applications and Challenges, Cybernetics and Systems, 55, 2, pp. 302-330, (2024); A Comprehensive Review on Cybersecurity Issues and their Mitigation Measures in Fintech, (2024); Alnasser Mohammed, Sulaiman Abdullah Saif, The relationship between agency theory, stakeholder theory and Shariah supervisory board in Islamic banking: An attempt towards discussion, Humanomics, 33, 1, pp. 75-83, (2017); J Softw Eng Appl, (2023); Association Between Corporate Governance and Artificial Intelligence AI in the Banking Sector in Asean, (2021); Cerchiello, Paola, Assessing Banks' Distress Using News and Regular Financial Data, Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence, 5, (2022); Chen, Huazhou, A deep learning CNN architecture applied in smart near-infrared analysis of water pollution for agricultural irrigation resources, Agricultural Water Management, 240, (2020); Clarke, Victoria, Teaching thematic analysis, Psychologist, 26, 2, pp. 120-123, (2013); Engineering International, (2017); Englisch, Holger, Deep treasury management for banks, Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence, 6, (2023)","","Frontiers Media SA","","","","","","26248212","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211615453"

However, there is a recognised need for the integration of Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered predictive analytics within the realm of arbitration in Malaysia. This note examines the role of integrating AI-powered predictive analytics in arbitration for resolving Islamic banking disputes. This integration is seen as a way to address several issues such as the potential arbitrator bias and the hesitation of referral a Shariah matter to Shariah Advisory Council (hereinafter referred to as “SAC”) or Shariah expert. The note argues that using AI-powered predictive analytics helps in minimising the negative impact of potential arbitrator bias, like religious and personal bias, and lack of expertise in Islamic banking disputes in Malaysia that are increasing the risk that Shariah-related matters would not be referred to the SAC or a Shariah expert. It is imperative to recognise that regardless of the advancements in AI, Almighty Allah has honoured the children of Adam with intellect, a unique attribute that distinguishes and elevates humanity. Therefore, there is a need to priorities the significance of humans over AI in decision-making processes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai-powered Predictive Analytics; Artificial Intelligence (ai); Dispute Resolution; Islamic Banking; Traditional Arbitration","","","","","Launch of Icd Lseg Islamic Finance Development Report 2023 Navigating Uncertainty Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector; Historical Development of Islamic Banking; International Journal of Legal Information, (2012); 8th International Conference on Islamic Economics and Finance Enhancing, (2011); Malaysian Financial Sector Bank Negara Malaysia; Malayan Law Journal, (2006); Mlju, (2019); Cbma, (2009); Cbma, (2009); Cbma, (2009)","","Electronicpublications.org Ltd","","","","","","26336626","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211202808"

As mobile banking continues to grow in popularity, safeguarding financial transactions and personal data becomes a top priority. This paper introduces an AI-enhanced secure mobile banking system that leverages Multi-Phase Authentication (MPA) to strengthen the authentication process. In this system, artificial intelligence is integrated with traditional authentication methods, creating a dynamic framework that assesses the risk level associated with each user interaction. Based on this real-time risk assessment, the system adjusts the authentication requirements, making them more stringent when higher risks are detected and more lenient when the risk is lower. This adaptive mechanism not only enhances the security of mobile banking by providing multiple layers of protection but also improves the user experience by reducing unnecessary authentication steps that can cause frustration and delay. The proposed system's effectiveness is validated through a series of simulations and case studies, which demonstrate significant improvements in key security metrics. These include a marked reduction in instances of fraud and lower false positive rates, which indicate that the system can accurately distinguish between legitimate and suspicious activities without imposing undue burden on users. Overall, the results of this study highlight the potential of AI-enhanced multi-phase authentication to provide a scalable and user-friendly solution for secure mobile banking. This approach represents a promising direction for the future of digital financial services, offering a balance between rigorous security and seamless user experience. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai-powered Security; Biometric Authentication; Cyber-attacks; Machine Learning; Mobile Banking Security; Multi-factor Authentication","","","","","Ahmad, Md Onais, BAuth-ZKP—A Blockchain-Based Multi-Factor Authentication Mechanism for Securing Smart Cities, Sensors, 23, 5, (2023); Ali, Guma, Two-factor authentication scheme for mobile money: A review of threat models and countermeasures, Future Internet, 12, 10, pp. 1-27, (2020); J Adv Comput Res, (2018); Alzu'bi, Ahmad, Masked face recognition using deep learning: A review, Electronics (Switzerland), 10, 21, (2021); Scalable Computing Practice and Experience, (2024); Sosyal Bilimler Arastrma Dergisi, (2020); Chaudhry, Shehzad Ashraf, A secure and efficient authenticated encryption for electronic payment systems using elliptic curve cryptography, Electronic Commerce Research, 16, 1, pp. 113-139, (2016); Dasgupta, Dipankar, Toward the design of adaptive selection strategies for multi-factor authentication, Computers and Security, 63, pp. 85-116, (2016); Elliot, Mbunge, A robust and scalable four factor authentication architecture to enhance security for mobile online transaction, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research, 7, 3, pp. 139-143, (2018); Harish, Water-Ice Exposing Scarps Within the Northern Midlatitude Craters on Mars, Geophysical Research Letters, 47, 14, (2020)","","International Academic Publishing House (IAPH)","","","","","","24554855","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211040067"

AI-powered banking chatbots are gaining popularity and present novel opportunities to provide 24/7 front-line support and customised banking assistance. Despite these advantages, banking chatbots are not widely used and have not been adopted as customer service in Indian banks. This research paper explores the obstacles associated with the widespread adoption of banking chatbots in the financial landscape. As disruptive technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP) continue to reshape the banking industry globally, understanding the specific barriers to chatbot integration becomes imperative. The current research contributes to the AI discipline by holistically examining the barriers to banking chatbot adoption in India using the Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) methodology. The study employs a three-step approach by identifying key barriers to adopting banking chatbots through an extensive literature review and experts' opinions. Then, the Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) methodology creates a hierarchical model. For this, data is collected from subject matter experts to develop the interpretive model. Thirdly, MICMAC analysis is conducted to classify and sort the corresponding variables based on their driving and dependence power. The analysis reveals that the absence of AI guidelines, lack of human touch and lack of audibility and transparency of AI systems are some of the critical barriers to the deployment of AI banking chatbots, requiring special focus to streamline the regulatory framework and anthropomorphic features of AI chatbot for successful implementation and deployment. Recommendations for practitioners and other stakeholders and research limitations are also discussed. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai Banking Chatbot; Artificial Intelligence; Barriers; Interpretive Structural Modeling (ism); Micmac; Structured Self-interaction Matrix (ssim)","","","","","Abdulquadri, Abdulazeez Olamide, Digital transformation in financial services provision: a Nigerian perspective to the adoption of chatbot, Journal of Enterprising Communities, 15, 2, pp. 258-281, (2021); Decision Making Applications in Management and Engineering, (2024); Alagarsamy, Subburaj, Exploring chatbot trust: Antecedents and behavioural outcomes, Heliyon, 9, 5, (2023); Al-Hasan, Tamim M., From Traditional Recommender Systems to GPT-Based Chatbots: A Survey of Recent Developments and Future Directions, Big Data and Cognitive Computing, 8, 4, (2024); Studia Universitatis Babes Bolyai Oeconomica, (2021); Attri, Rajesh Kumar, ISM-MICMAC approach for evaluating the critical success factors of 5S implementation in manufacturing organisations, International Journal of Business Excellence, 20, 4, pp. 521-548, (2020); Balakrishnan, Janarthanan, The role of meta-UTAUT factors, perceived anthropomorphism, perceived intelligence, and social self-efficacy in chatbot-based services?, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 180, (2022); Belanche, Daniel, Artificial Intelligence in FinTech: understanding robo-advisors adoption among customers, Industrial Management and Data Systems, 119, 7, pp. 1411-1430, (2019); International Journal of Human Computer Interaction, (2023); Journal of Financial Compliance, (2019)","","International Association for Computer Information Systems","","","","","","15297314","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206302839"

However, this professional technological integration remains unexplored in the Jordanian banking sector. Accordingly, understanding the mechanism of integration between these factors is essential to keep pace with the evolving work environment. This study aims to examine how these factors affect the adoption of remote auditing supported by artificial intelligence in Jordanian banks. Method: a quantitative approach consistent with a cross-sectional design was used to collect primary research data. A structured questionnaire was distributed to 158 decision-makers in various commercial banks in Jordan. The questionnaire measured individual factors (e.g., skill level of users and Attitude towards technology) and technological factors (e.g., technology readiness, data security and privacy, and integration capabilities). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the relationships between these factors and intention to adopt AI-powered remote auditing using SMART PLS. Results: the results depicted that all factors, including individual and technological factors, significantly influenced the adoption of AI-powered remote auditing. Attitude towards technology and integration capabilities were the strongest predictors. Additionally, technology readiness, data security and privacy, and skill level of users had moderate but significant, effects on adoption intention. Conclusion: the findings emphasize that both individual perceptions and technological robustness are crucial for adopting AI-powered remote auditing in Jordanian banks. Improving system reliability and showcasing the benefits of AI tools can significantly boost adoption rates. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai-powered Remote Auditing; Attitude Towards Technology; Auditor Skill Level; Data Security And Privacy; Integration Capabilities; Technology Readiness","","","","The Researchers would like to thank the Deanship of Graduate Studies and Scientific Research at Qassim University for financial support (QU-APC-2024-9/1).","Jaradat, Zaid, Towards sustainability in SMEs post recovery from COVID-19 crisis: the influence of intellectual capital and cost strategy, International Journal of Productivity and Quality Management, 39, 1, pp. 97-119, (2023); Lamboglia, Rita, Exploring the relationship between audit and technology.

Consequently, this research aims to answer these calls by providing and empirically testing a conceptual model that simultaneously take into account AI, KMP and BSC with regard to their interactions with and effects on OP. The main aim of this research is to assess the association between AI and OP; and whether this association is mediated through the bank’s KMP and through BSC implementation. To achieve this aim, nine hypotheses have been formulated and tested through a web-based survey that was distributed to 594 employees working in commercial banks operated in MENA region. The data have been analyzed using the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique. The findings demonstrate the positive impact of the adoption of AI on KMP, BSC and OP along with the impact of KMP on BSC and OP. The findings also reveal that KMP act as a mediator through which AI influences BSC and OP. Further, the findings show that BSC has a significant positive effect on OP and act as a mediator through which AI influences OP. Hence, this research demonstrates that banks interested in using AI to improve performance must be very careful when taking KMP into account as a mediator mechanism. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Balanced Scorecard; Business, Management And Accounting; Commercial Banks; Finance; Information Technology; Knowledge Management Practices; Mena Region; Organizational Performance","","","","","Abrokwah-Larbi, Kwabena, The impact of artificial intelligence in marketing on the performance of business organizations: evidence from SMEs in an emerging economy, Journal of Entrepreneurship in Emerging Economies, 16, 4, pp. 1090-1117, (2024); Abuaddous, Hayfa Yousef, The impact of knowledge management on organizational performance, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 9, 4, pp. 204-208, (2018); Abueid, Raed A.I., The impact of balanced scorecard in estimating the performance of banks in Palestine, EuroMed Journal of Business, 18, 1, pp. 34-45, (2023); 2nd International Conference on Sustainability and Equity ICSE 2021, (2022); Fwu Journal of Social Sciences, (2015); AI Adoption and Firm Performance Management Versus IT, (2020); Effect of Knowledge Management on Organizational Performance Using the Balanced Scorecard Perspectives Jordanian Private Hospitals in the City of Amman A Case Study Mba, (2014); Alharbi, Ghadah Lafi, The effects of knowledge management processes on service sector performance: evidence from Saudi Arabia, Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, 11, 1, (2024); Alhashmi, Shaikha F.S., Critical Success Factors for Implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) Projects in Dubai Government United Arab Emirates (UAE) Health Sector: Applying the Extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 1058, pp. 393-405, (2020); Ali, Anna, Prevalence and predictors of teenage pregnancy in Pakistan: A trend analysis from Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey datasets from 1990 to 2018, International Health, 14, 2, pp. 176-182, (2022)","","Cogent OA","","","","","","23311975","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204961279"

A hacker is a person who gains access to another person's financial information. Improving feature selection is important to detect transaction risk in large, multidimensional data. Fraud detection and classification performance is divided into two parts: training data and test data. During this process we have focused on data analysis and pre-processing. In a transaction’s dataset, the predictive variables influence how well a machine learning algorithm for transaction risk identification classifies and identifies fraudulent transactions. This study examines the application of machine learning techniques in improving fraud detection in the banking industry. Using advanced algorithms and historical transaction data, the model aims to identify anomalous patterns that indicate fraudulent activity. Feature engineering, ensemble methods, and anomaly detection algorithms are used to improve the accuracy and performance of fraud detection systems. reducing false positives and provides an adaptive security mechanism. By harnessing the power of machine learning, this approach aims to strengthen the banking sectors defines against sophisticated fraud schemes.

Customization of offerings is crucial for banks serving individuals, families, or businesses across various financial stages. Client segmentation stands out as a primary strategy in achieving this customization. By categorizing customers based on shared characteristics, banks can deploy targeted marketing efforts, allocate resources efficiently, and deliver tailored banking experiences. In the contemporary banking landscape, where vast amounts of data are generated daily, thorough analysis is indispensable. Customized business strategies have become increasingly vital amidst intensifying industry competition. Customer segmentation serves as a pivotal aspect of market research, facilitating the grouping of customers based on common characteristics and behaviors. This segmentation enables banks to tailor marketing campaigns to suit the distinct requirements and preferences of each segment. This study focuses on employing cluster analysis, a statistical technique for organizing data points, to achieve efficient client segmentation in the banking sector. Specifically, we utilize the K-means algorithm, a popular clustering method, to categorize clientele into discrete groups based on transaction history, banking preferences, and demographic data. To ensure the accuracy and robustness of our segmentation methodology, sophisticated machine learning techniques like the Elbow and Silhouette methods are employed. These techniques enable the evaluation of clustering effectiveness and determination of the optimal number of clusters. Our objective is to utilize machine learning to identify meaningful and actionable customer groups, guiding banks' strategic decision-making processes. The segmentation approach outlined in this study empowers banks to optimize services and elevate customer satisfaction levels. By aligning offerings with the specific needs of each segment, banks can cultivate stronger customer relationships, drive revenue growth, and gain a competitive advantage in the dynamic banking landscape. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking Industry; Cluster Analysis; Customer Segmentation; Machine Learning Techniques; Strategic Decision-making","","","","","IEEE, (2003); Customer Segmentation Using K Means Clustering, (2019); Whos Who Understanding Your Business with Customer Segmentation; Ultimate Guide to Customer Segmentation how to Organize Your Customers to Grow Better, (2024); undefined; Irjet, (2021); Anastasia, Griva, Retail business analytics: Customer visit segmentation using market basket data, Expert Systems with Applications, 100, pp. 1-16, (2018); Cluster Analysis, (1974); Ijcrt Aman Banduni and Ilavendhan A, (2018); IEEE, (2024)","","International Publications","","","","","","1074133X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203797535"

The data set of the variables consists of a total of 44 observation points between the 1st quarter of 2012 and the 4th quarter of 2022. The cointegration relationship between the variables is examined using the ARDL cointegration test. According to the F statistic results for cointegration hypothesis testing, there is a statistically significant relationship between the variables at a 1% significance level. In the long run, a 1% increase in Chat Box users causes an increase of approximately 0.2% in the number of mobile banking users. A 1% increase in Chat Box users in the short term increases the number of mobile banking users in the current period by approximately 0.03%. A 1% increase in video call users in the long term causes an increase of approximately 0.04% in the number of mobile banking users. A 1% increase in the number of video calls in the current period increases current period mobile banking applications by approximately 0.005%. It has been determined that the effect of chat box applications on mobile banking is higher than that of video call applications. In addition, there is a close correlation between mobile banking and the independent variable chat box, no correlation between mobile banking and video calling, and a moderate correlation between chat box and video calling. All findings mean that artificial intelligence applications positively contribute to the expansion of mobile banking. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Database Systems Journal, (2015); Gfk Marketing Intelligence Review, (2017); Sutanto, Juliana, Addressing the personalization-privacy paradox: An empirical assessment from a field experiment on smartphone users, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 37, 4, pp. 1141-1164, (2013); Albashrawi, Mousa, Privacy and Personalization in Continued Usage Intention of Mobile Banking: An Integrative Perspective, Information Systems Frontiers, 21, 5, pp. 1031-1043, (2019); Journal of Academic Value Studies, (2021); Turkey International Journal of Financial Economics and Banking Practices, (2020); Banks Association of Turkey Bat Reports, (2024); Digital Internet and Mobile Banking Statistics Report, (2023); Bucak Isletme Fakultesi Dergisi, (2020); Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Humanity, (2020)","","Hindawi Limited","","","","","","16875893; 16875907","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203637661"

Bank loans have emerged as one of the most recent services offered over the past several decades. Banks typically serve as intermediaries for loans, investments, short-term loans, and other types of credit. The usage of credit cards is experiencing a steady increase, thereby leading to a rise in the default rate that banks encounter. Although there has been much research investigating the efficacy of conventional Machine Learning (ML) models, there has been relatively less emphasis on Deep Learning (DL) techniques. The application of DL approaches to credit card default prediction has not been extensively researched despite their considerable potential in numerous fields. Moreover, the current literature frequently lacks particular information regarding the DL structures, hyperparameters, and optimization techniques employed. To predict credit card default, this study evaluates the efficacy of a DL model and compares it to other ML models, such as Decision Tree (DT) and Adaboost. The objective of this research is to identify the specific DL parameters that contribute to the observed enhancements in the accuracy of credit card default prediction. This research makes use of the UCI ML repository to access the credit card defaulted customer dataset. Subsequently, various techniques are employed to preprocess the unprocessed data and visually present the outcomes through the use of exploratory data analysis (EDA). Furthermore, the algorithms are hypertuned to evaluate the enhancement in prediction. We used standard evaluation metrics to evaluate all the models. The evaluation indicates that the AdaBoost and DT exhibit the highest accuracy rate of 82 ​% in predicting credit card default, surpassing the accuracy of the ANN model, which is 78 ​%. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ada Boost; Credit Card Default Prediction; Decision Tree; Deep Learning; Machine Learning; Adversarial Machine Learning; Ada Boost; Bank Loans; Banking Sectors; Credit Card Default Prediction; Credit Cards; Deep Learning; Learning Techniques; Machine Learning Models; Machine-learning; Short-term Loans; Prediction Models","Adversarial machine learning; Ada boost; Bank loans; Banking sectors; Credit card default prediction; Credit cards; Deep learning; Learning techniques; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Short-term loans; Prediction models","","","","Sun, Ting, Predicting credit card delinquencies: An application of deep neural networks, Intelligent Systems in Accounting, Finance and Management, 25, 4, pp. 174-189, (2018); Sayjadah, Yashna, Credit Card Default Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques, (2018); Teng, Hueiwen Wen, Estimation procedures of using five alternative machine learning methods for predicting credit card default, Review of Pacific Basin Financial Markets and Policies, 22, 3, (2019); Syam, Niladri B., Waiting for a sales renaissance in the fourth industrial revolution: Machine learning and artificial intelligence in sales research and practice, Industrial Marketing Management, 69, pp. 135-146, (2018); Ebiaredoh-Mienye, Sarah A., Artificial neural network technique for improving prediction of credit card default: A stacked sparse autoencoder approach, International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 11, 5, pp. 4392-4402, (2021); Application of Machine Learning Algorithms in Predicting Credit Card Default Payment, (2019); Alam, Talha Mahboob, An investigation of credit card default prediction in the imbalanced datasets, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 201173-201198, (2020); Tanouz, D., Credit card fraud detection using machine learning, pp. 967-972, (2021); Adepoju, Olawale, Comparative Evaluation of Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning Techniques, (2019); Alfaiz, Noor Saleh, Enhanced Credit Card Fraud Detection Model Using Machine Learning, Electronics (Switzerland), 11, 4, (2022)","","KeAi Communications Co.","","","","","","26673452","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203545925"

Methodology: Quantitative survey data was collected from 130 bank personnel. Multi-item reflective measures assessed AI adoption, internal controls, and financial reporting quality—structural equation modelling analysis relationships between constructs. Findings: The research tested four hypotheses grounded in agency and contingency theories. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated sound measurement models. Structural equation modelling revealed that AI adoption significantly transformed financial reporting quality. The mediating effect of internal controls on the AI-quality relationship was supported. Specifically, the path from AI adoption to quality was significant, indicating a positive impact. Despite internal controls strongly predicting quality, its mediating effect significantly shaped the degree of transformation driven by AI adoption. The indirect effect of AI on quality through internal controls was also significant. Findings imply a growing diffusion of AI applications in core financial reporting systems. Practical implications: Increasing AI applications focus on holistically transforming systems, reflecting committing adoption. Jordanian banks selectively leverage controls to moderate AI-induced transformations. Originality/value: This study provides essential real-world insights into how AI is adopted and impacts the Jordanian banking sector, a key player in a fast-evolving developing economy. By examining the role of internal controls, it deepens our understanding of how AI works in practice and offers practical advice for integrating technology effectively and improving information quality. Its mixed methods, unique context, and focus on AI’s impact on organizations significantly enrich academic literature.

The results from the PCA-LSTM model were compared to predictions generated directly by the LSTM model, simple autoregression and random walk, which serves as a benchmark. Overall, LSTM predictions are the most accurate with PCA-LSTM being a close second, nonetheless PCA-LSTM is more accurate in short-term forecasting of interest rates at long maturities. Both methods outperform the benchmark, while autoregression usually underperforms. For these reasons, the PCA-LSTM as well as the LSTM can be useful in interest rate management or building trading strategies.

This change is making them better, customer-oriented and financially rewarding organizations. Big data and AI have been useful in the banking and financial institutions to assess and manage the risks. Through the analysis of big amounts of unstructured data in real time, AI algorithms are capable of identifying risks. This makes it easy to put preventive measures in place to avert the risks. In addition, big data and AI have come a long way in solving the problem of fraud in banking and finance. This paper showed how big data and AI improve risk management, Cyber threat, and fraud in banking and finance by using data analysis and data pattern identification in real-time. That is why our work emphasizes the importance of implementing secure privacy and explaining the AI algorithm to eliminate ethical and Cyber security issues. Using analytical approaches, AI can identify the transactions with the help of comparison with the previous data and the behavioral characteristics related to the fraud. This approach to fraud prevention has been effective in reducing losses while at the same time improving the customer’s confidence in the company.

Numerous researches on internet banking have discovered that the opinions and experiences of customers are crucial to the service’s effectiveness. To determine factors influencing internet banking adoption, the study may employ the use of technology and unified theory of acceptance anxiety, and security risk. For the data collection, 116 replies were received, and factor analysis was performed using PLS-SEM. The SEM found that roughly 55.66% of the variation in intention of users to use digital banking was explained by predictors.

Design/methodology/approach: Using a quantitative method, the study collected 495 data from Gen Y (204) and Z (291) respondents who were users of digital banking apps through structured questionnaires that were analysed using PLS-SEM. The latter helped investigate the driving forces of AI characteristics and user behavioural intentions as well as reveal generation-specific features of digital banking engagement. Findings: The study revealed that PAN and PIN have significant positive effects on the anthropomorphic perceptions of digital banking apps, which in turn increases perceived usefulness, satisfaction, and continuous intentions. In particular, the influence of these AI attributes varies across generations; Gen Y’s loyalty is mostly based on the benefits derived from AI features, whereas Gen Z places a greater value on the anthropomorphic factor of AI. This marked a generational shift in the demand for digital banking services. Research limitations/implications: The specificity of Indian Gen Y and Z users defines the scope of this study, suggesting that demographic and geographical boundaries can be broadened in future AI-related banking research. Practical implications: The results have important implications for bank executive officers and policymakers in developing AI-supported digital banking interfaces that appeal to the unique tastes of millennial customers, thus emphasising the importance of personalising AI functionalities to enhance user participation and loyalty. Originality/value: This study enriches the digital banking literature by combining AI attributes with ECT, offering a granular understanding of AI’s role in modulating young consumers' satisfaction and continuance intentions. It underscores the strategic imperative of AI in cultivating compelling and loyalty-inducing digital banking environments tailored to the evolving expectations of Generations Y and Z. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Digital Banking Apps; Expectation Confirmation Theory","","","","","Abdul-Halim, Nurul Ain, Understanding the determinants of e-wallet continuance usage intention in Malaysia, Quality and Quantity, 56, 5, pp. 3413-3439, (2022); Agrawal, Durgesh Kumar, Determining behavioural differences of Y and Z generational cohorts in online shopping, International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, 50, 7, pp. 880-895, (2022); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Akhtar, Sadia, Factors influencing individuals' intention to adopt mobile banking in China and Pakistan: The moderating role of cultural values, Journal of Public Affairs, 19, 1, (2019); Alavi, Shirin, An Empirical Segmentation of Users of Mobile Banking Apps, Journal of Internet Commerce, 15, 4, pp. 390-407, (2016); Ali, Syed Mithun, Evaluating factors contributing to the failure of information system in the banking industry, PLOS ONE, 17, 3 March, (2022); Ameen, Nisreen A., Customer experiences in the age of artificial intelligence, Computers in Human Behavior, 114, (2021); Arora, Nidhi, Generation Y: Perspective, engagement, expectations, preferences and satisfactions from workplace; a study conducted in Indian context, Benchmarking, 26, 5, pp. 1378-1404, (2019); Aw, Eugene Cheng Xi, Counteracting dark sides of robo-advisors: justice, privacy and intrusion considerations, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 42, 1, pp. 133-151, (2024); Axcell, Shana, Exploring the attitudes and behaviour of Gen Z students towards branded mobile apps in an emerging market: UTAUT2 model extension, Young Consumers, 24, 2, pp. 184-202, (2023)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","00251747","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197917420"

Financial service providers should distinguish between low- and high-quality customers to predict credit risk accurately. Proper management of credit risk exposure contributes to the long-term viability and profitability of banks, systemic stability, and efficient capital allocation in the economy. Moreover, it benefits the development of supply chain finance. Supply chain finance offers convenient loan transactions that benefit all participants, including the buyer, supplier, and bank. However, poor credit risk management in supply chain finance may cause losses for finance providers and hamper the development of supply chain finance. Machine learning algorithms have significantly improved the accuracy of credit risk prediction systems in supply chain finance. However, their lack of interpretability or transparency makes decision-makers skeptical. Therefore, this study aims to improve AI transparency by ranking the importance of features influencing the decisions made by the system. This study identifies two effective algorithms, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models, for credit risk detection. The factors that influenced the decision of the models to make them transparent are explicitly illustrated. This study also contributes to the literature on explainable credit risk detection for supply chain finance and provides practical implications for financial institutions to inform decision making. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Credit Risk Analysis; Explainable Artificial Intelligence; Machine Learning; Supply Chain Finance","","","","This work is partly supported by VC Research (VCR 0000182).","Abedin, Mohammad Zoynul, Combining weighted SMOTE with ensemble learning for the class-imbalanced prediction of small business credit risk, Complex and Intelligent Systems, 9, 4, pp. 3559-3579, (2023); Oxford Handbook of Credit Derivatives, (2011); Emerging Markets Corporate Bonds A Scoring System, (2025); Apley, Daniel W., Visualizing the effects of predictor variables in black box supervised learning models, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

However, there is mixed evidence on whether these incumbents benefit from digital platform strategies. To provide systematic insights, we focus on the banking industry. With the emergence of open banking, banks have begun implementing digital platforms to unlock the innovative power of third-party developers. We conducted an event study based on the announcement of digital platform strategies in a global sample of 165 banks. We show that, on average, investors react positively to the announcements. Contrary to our expectations, this effect is more substantial for banks from emerging markets than those from developed markets. Prior artificial intelligence (AI) orientation only partly contributes to investors’ favorable perception of a digital platform strategy. These results point to the complex interplay of AI orientation and digital platform strategies, yielding questions for future research. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai Orientation; Apis; Banks; Digital Platform Ecosystems; Digital Platform Strategies; Emerging Markets; Event Study; Open Banking; Commerce; Api; Artificial Intelligence Orientation; Digital Platform Ecosystem; Digital Platform Strategy; Digital Platforms; Emerging Markets; Event Studies; Open Banking; Platform Ecosystems; Platform Strategy; Investments","Commerce; API; Artificial intelligence orientation; Digital platform ecosystem; Digital platform strategy; Digital platforms; Emerging markets; Event studies; Open banking; Platform ecosystems; Platform strategy; Investments","","","This work was partly funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [project no. 444990299] and the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [project no.

Banking data has significant financial implications and is confidential. Combining users data from several organizations for various banking services may result in various intrusions and privacy leakages. As a result, this study employs federated learning (FL) using a flower paradigm to preserve each organization’s privacy while collaborating to build a robust shared global model. However, diverse data distributions in the collaborative training process might result in inadequate model learning and a lack of privacy. To address this issue, the present paper proposes the implementation of Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Federated Proximal (FedProx) methods in the flower framework, which take advantage of the data locality while training and guaranteeing global convergence. Resultantly improves the privacy of the local models. This analysis used the credit card and Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection Evaluation (CICIDS) datasets. Precision, recall, and accuracy as performance indicators to show the efficacy of the proposed strategy using FedAvg and FedProx. The experimental findings suggest that the proposed approach helps to safely use banking data from diverse sources to enhance customer banking services by obtaining accuracy of 99.55% and 83.72% for FedAvg and 99.57%, and 84.63% for FedProx. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fedavg; Federated Learning; Fedprox; Financial Sectors; Flower Framework; Privacy Preservation; Intrusion Detection; Learning Systems; Privacy-preserving Techniques; Banking Services; Data Pool; Federated Averaging; Federated Learning; Federated Proximal; Financial Sectors; Flower Framework; Machine-learning; Privacy Preservation; Privacy Preserving; Finance","Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Privacy-preserving techniques; Banking services; Data pool; Federated averaging; Federated learning; Federated proximal; Financial sectors; Flower framework; Machine-learning; Privacy preservation; Privacy preserving; Finance","","","","Li, Qinbin, A Survey on Federated Learning Systems: Vision, Hype and Reality for Data Privacy and Protection, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 35, 4, pp. 3347-3366, (2023); McMahan, H.

In this paper, we address the problem of customer churn in the banking sector by selecting and applying four machine learning algorithms on the dataset of the U.S Bank in the case of Imbalance and Balance to predict the churn of customers from financial institutions such as banks and the reasons that drive them to do so. The algorithms were Logistics Regression, SVM, Neural network and Random Forest. The CRISP model was followed for the necessary processing and analysis, as it became clear after that the Random Forest algorithm provided better results in all cases. Consequently, this paper attempted to provide a better improvement to the results obtained from the default Random-Forest algorithm by understanding its working mechanism and adjusting its hyperparameters. Therefore, a mathematical model was proposed and built for the default Random Forest algorithm as a new version of it called ERFA. The final results of ERFA were positive through an increase in prediction accuracy from 85% to 86% in the case of the imbalanced dataset and from 89% to 91% in the case of balanced dataset. The outcomes of this study can help and motivate bank managers in general and in Yemen in particular to adopt this type of smart strategies to maintain their customers and provide them with a better experience. Furthermore, the mechanism established by this paper may help researchers who are interested in the field of developing smart business models. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai; Banking; Banking Sectors; Customer Churn; Industries; Machine Learning Algorithms; Machine Learning Algorithms; Prediction Algorithms; Radio Frequency; Random Forest; Random Forests; Support Vector Machines; Forecasting; Learning Algorithms; Sales; Banking Sectors; Customer Churns; Machine Learning Algorithms; Prediction Algorithms; Radiofrequencies; Random Forest Algorithm; Random Forests; Support Vectors Machine; Support Vector Machines","Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Sales; Banking sectors; Customer churns; Machine learning algorithms; Prediction algorithms; Radiofrequencies; Random forest algorithm; Random forests; Support vectors machine; Support vector machines","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","aip","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192136768"

The RAs use objective algorithms to select portfolios, reduce behavioural biases, and improve transactions. They are inexpensive, accessible, and transparent platforms. Objective algorithms improve the believability of portfolio selection. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a qualitative approach consisting of an exploratory examination of seven different RA case studies and analyses the RA platforms used in the banking industry. Findings: The findings provide two different approaches to running a business that are appropriate for either fully automated or hybrid RAs through the realisation of two platform model frameworks. The research reveals that relying solely on algorithms and not including any services involving human interaction in a company model is inadequate to meet the requirements of customers in decision-making. Research limitations/implications: This study emphasises key robo-advisory features, such as investor profiling, asset allocation, investment strategies, portfolio rebalancing, and performance evaluation. These features provide managers and practitioners with new information on enhancing client satisfaction, improving services, and adjusting to dynamic market demands. Originality/value: This study fills the research gap related to the analysis of RA platform models by providing a meticulous analysis of two different types of RAs, namely, fully automated and hybrid, which have not received adequate attention in the literature. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking; Business Model; Digital Platform; Investment; Robo-advisor; Wealth Management","","","","","Allweins, Marcel M., The Platform Canvas—Conceptualization of a Design Framework for Multi-Sided Platform Businesses, Entrepreneurship Education and Pedagogy, 4, 3, pp. 455-477, (2021); Research Journal of Finance and Accounting, (2016); Journal of Banking and Financial Technology, (2019); Appio, Francesco Paolo, Digital Transformation and Innovation Management: A Synthesis of Existing Research and an Agenda for Future Studies, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 38, 1, pp. 4-20, (2021); Ardito, Lorenzo, Mapping innovation dynamics in the Internet of Things domain: Evidence from patent analysis, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 136, pp. 317-330, (2018); Ardito, Lorenzo, Towards Industry 4.0: Mapping digital technologies for supply chain management-marketing integration, Business Process Management Journal, 25, 2, pp. 323-346, (2019); Arnaut, Dino, FinTech Innovations as Disruptor of the Traditional Financial Industry, Contributions to Finance and Accounting, Part F233, pp. 233-254, (2023); Au, Cam Duc, Business model of sustainable robo-advisors: Empirical insights for practical implementation, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 23, (2021); Dal Mas, Francesca, Defining the concept of business model: Searching for a business model framework, International Journal of Knowledge and Systems Science, 9, 3, pp. 48-64, (2018); Digital Business Models for Industry 4 0, (2022)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","00251747","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191315544"

With data analysis and artificial intelligence, extracting valuable information from historical data, to lower their losses, banks would be able to classify their customers and predict the probability of credit repayment instead of relying on traditional methods. As most actual research is focused on individuals’ loans, the novelty of the present paper is to treat corporate loans. Its main objective is to propose a model to address the problem using selected machine learning algorithms to classify companies into two classes to be able to predict loan defaulters. This paper delves into the Corporate Loan Default Prediction Model (CLD PM), which is designed to forecast loan defaults in corporations. The model is grounded in the CRISP-DM process, commencing with comprehending corporate requirements and implementing classification techniques. The data acquisition and preparation phase are critical in testing the selected algorithms, which involve Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Adaboost. The model's efficacy is assessed using various metrics, namely Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score, and AUC. Subsequently, the model is scrutinized using an actual dataset of loans for Moroccan real estate firms. The findings reveal that the Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms outperformed the others, with every metric surpassing 90%. This was accomplished by utilizing SMOTE as an oversampling method, given the dataset's imbalance. Furthermore, when concentrating on financial statements, selecting the five most significant financial ratios and the company's age, Random Forest was adept at predicting defaulters with good results: accuracy of 90%, precision of 75%, recall of 50%, F1 score of 60% and AUC of 77%. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Bank; Companies; Corporate; Data Analysis; Loan Default; Machine Learning; Prediction; Real Estate; Adaptive Boosting; Classification (of Information); Data Acquisition; Data Handling; Decision Trees; Logistic Regression; Random Forests; Support Vector Machines; Banking Systems; Commercial Bank; Core Business; Corporates; F1 Scores; Learning Based Models; Loan Default; Machine-learning; Real-estates; Forecasting","Adaptive boosting; Classification (of information); Data acquisition; Data handling; Decision trees; Logistic regression; Random forests; Support vector machines; Banking systems; Commercial bank; Core business; Corporates; F1 scores; Learning Based Models; Loan default; Machine-learning; Real-estates; Forecasting","","","","Roy, Abhijeet Guha, Credit Risk Assessment Using Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine Based Data Analytics, Advances in Science, Technology and Innovation, pp. 79-84, (2019); Journal of Computer Science and Engineering Jcse, (2022); Zhang, Xiaoming, Consumer credit risk assessment: A review from the state-of-the-art classification algorithms, data traits, and learning methods, Expert Systems with Applications, 237, (2024); Zhang, Lifang, What should lenders be more concerned about?

There is still a considerable gap in the research on how online risk and socio-economic factors influence customers’ intention to engage in Internet banking activities. To fill this gap, we took an online and socio-economic perspective on Internet banking adoption in an aspiring to-be IT-enabled economy. Our study adopted a quantitative research approach. Intercept surveys were conducted among 672 bank customers in Ghana. Seven hypotheses were developed, and partial-least square structural equation modelling was used to test the relationship between the variables. Our findings revealed that fear of financial loss, fear of reputation damage, avoidance motivation, price of digital devices, perceived knowledge gap, infrastructure gap, and perceived financial charge are significant barriers to e-banking adoption.

Despite the significant advantages of ATMs, fraud has become a very high risk and danger. As it leads to controlling all clients' accounts. In this paper, the proposed framework is using the iris recognition technology combined with the one-time password (OTP) to detect and prevent the known as well as the unknown attacks on ATMs and provide a table of the attackers and the suspected attackers with a counter to take a preventive action with them. Our proposed preventive actions are: card withdrawal, flagging the identified iris as an attacker in the database, notifying the card owner with this suspicious behavior, reporting to the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE), and calling the police when an attacker's iris counts three capturing times, even if for a different card. Two case studies were attempted to achieve the highest accuracy, the first case was using the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Automation V1.0 (CASIAIrisV1) dataset using the Cosine Distance. The second one was using the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IITD) dataset using k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) techniques together reaching 100% accuracy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automated Teller Machines (atms); Banking; Biometrics; Digital Banking; Fraud Detection; Fraud Prevention; Image Processing; Iris Recognition; Machine Learning; One Time Password (otp); Security; Authentication; Automation; Crime; E-learning; Image Enhancement; Machine Learning; Nearest Neighbor Search; Automated Teller Machine; Automated Teller Machines; Digital Banking; Fraud Detection; Fraud Prevention; Images Processing; Iris Recognition; Machine-learning; One Time Password; One-time; Security; Biometrics","Authentication; Automation; Crime; E-learning; Image enhancement; Machine learning; Nearest neighbor search; Automated teller machine; Automated teller machines; Digital banking; Fraud detection; Fraud prevention; Images processing; Iris recognition; Machine-learning; One time password; One-time; Security; Biometrics","","","","Embarak, Ossama H., A two-steps prevention model of ATM frauds communications, pp. 306-311, (2018); International Journal for Research in Applied Science Engineering Technology Ijraset, (2020); Future Computing and Informatics Journal, (2025); International Journal of Computer Applications, (2015); Future Computing and Informatics Journal, (2022); Idrees, Amira Mohamed, A Collaborative Mining-Based Decision Support Model for Granting Personal Loans in the Banking Sector, International Journal of E-Services and Mobile Applications, 14, 1, (2022); Siddiqui, Ahmad Tasnim, Biometrics to control ATM scams: A study, pp. 1598-1602, (2014); International Journal of Computer Science Issues, (2012); International Journal of Engineering Research and, (2020); Ijascse, (2013)","","Science and Information Organization","","","","","","21565570; 2158107X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187225602"

This uncertainty has led to investment hesitation within the digital currency market. Previous research attempts have presented methodologies for price forecasting and trend prediction in cryptocurrencies. However, these forecasts have typically suffered from increased error rates, leaving the opportunity for improvement in this field. Furthermore, the influence of sentiment-based factors could compromise the reliability of price predictions. In this research, we have proposed a machine learning-driven framework that provides precise cryptocurrency price projections and adds an alert mechanism to guide investors. Our fundamental analyzer, Bi-LSTM and GRU hybrid model use historical data of digital currencies to train and reliably anticipate future values. Complementing this, a sentiment analyzer, utilizing a BERT and VADER hybrid model, analyzes sentiments to assess the forecast price as trustworthy or uncertain. Besides assisting investor decision-making, this technique also helps risk management in the dynamic realm of cryptocurrency. Our suggested approach delivers highly precise price predictions with dramatically decreased error rates compared to prior competitive studies. The proposed Bi-LSTM-GRU-BERT-VADER (BLGBV) model is tested for three cryptocurrencies, namely BTC, ETH, and Dogecoin and reports an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0241%, 0.0645%, and 0.0978%, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bearish; Bi-lstm; Bullish; Candlestick; Cryptocurrency; Gru; Machine Learning; Price Prediction; Sentiment; Technical Analysis; Costs; Data Mining; Decision Making; Electronic Trading; Errors; Financial Markets; Forecasting; Investments; Learning Algorithms; Learning Systems; Long Short-term Memory; Mean Square Error; Risk Management; Sentiment Analysis; Bearish; Bi-lstm; Block-chain; Bullish; Candlestick; Gru; Machine-learning; Market Researches; On-line Banking; Predictive Models; Price Prediction; Sentiment; Technical Analysis; Blockchain","Costs; Data mining; Decision making; Electronic trading; Errors; Financial markets; Forecasting; Investments; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Mean square error; Risk management; Sentiment analysis; Bearish; Bi-LSTM; Block-chain; Bullish; Candlestick; GRU; Machine-learning; Market researches; On-line banking; Predictive models; Price prediction; Sentiment; Technical analysis; Blockchain","","","","Gupta, Rajesh, Smart Contract Privacy Protection Using AI in Cyber-Physical Systems: Tools, Techniques and Challenges, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 24746-24772, (2020); Gautam, Kartik, Empirical Analysis of Current Cryptocurrencies in Different Aspects, pp. 344-348, (2020); Adams, Richard J., Blockchain for Good?

By amalgamating quantitative assessment of banking metrics with qualitative insights from bank documentation and dialogues with banking leaders, we offer a comprehensive perspective. Key indicators that signal economic crises include escalating numbers of non-performing loans, waning profitability, and shrinking capital ratios. In response, banks have adopted strategies such as reshaping their loan portfolios, bolstering capital reserves, and refining their risk assessment protocols. This research underscores the paramountcy of promptly detecting economic downturns and deploying efficacious strategies to safeguard financial equilibrium. We structured our approach in three pivotal phases: firstly, countering overfitting through regularization; next, utilizing boosting to minimize loss during each iteration; and finally, addressing edge cases. Our proposed framework commences with data partitioning. This is succeeded by statistical preprocessing, yielding a detailed multivariate analysis for the ensuing model.

From employing dyadic samples of 283 bankers and 468 SME clients, results show that guanxi increases the relational aspect of relationship performance. We further demonstrate the significant negative moderating effects of perceived ease of use and usefulness. Chinese bankers hold different views from their clients as they believe the functionality and benefits of AI technology (e.g., ease of use and usefulness) do not interfere with their interpersonal guanxi with clients.

The reason for this is its direct effect on serving the customers of these institutions, reducing operating costs and remaining as a reliable and valid financial service provider. On the other hand, in recent years, with the development of information and communication technology, electronic banking has become very popular. In the meantime, it is inevitable to use fraud detection techniques to prevent fraudulent actions in banking systems, especially electronic banking systems. In this paper, a method has been developed that leads to the improvement of fraud detection in information security and cyber defense systems. The main purpose of fraud detection systems is to predict and detect false financial transactions and improve the intrusion detection system using information classification. In this regard, the genetic algorithm, which is known as one of the stochastic optimization methods, is used. At the end, the results of the genetic algorithm have been compared with the results of the decision tree classification and the regression tree.

To date, research on investigating the class imbalance problem has mainly focused on indicating and reducing the adverse effect of the class imbalance on the predictive accuracy of machine learning techniques, while the impact of that on machine learning interpretability has never been studied in the literature. This paper fills this gap by analysing how the stability of Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), two popular interpretation methods, are affected by class imbalance. Our experiments use 2016–2020 UK residential mortgage data collected from European Datawarehouse. We evaluate the stability of LIME and SHAP on datasets of progressively increased class imbalance. The results show that interpretations generated from LIME and SHAP are less stable as the class imbalance increases, which indicates that the class imbalance does have an adverse effect on machine learning interpretability. To check the robustness of our outcomes, we also analyse two open-source credit scoring datasets and we obtain similar results. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Credit Scoring; Interpretability; Machine Learning; Or In Banking; Stability; Lime; Adverse Effect; Class Imbalance; Class Imbalance Problems; Credit Scoring; Interpretability; Machine-learning; On-machines; Or In Banking; Predictive Accuracy; Shapley; Machine Learning","Lime; Adverse effect; Class imbalance; Class imbalance problems; Credit scoring; Interpretability; Machine-learning; On-machines; OR in banking; Predictive accuracy; Shapley; Machine learning","","","Raffaella Calabrese acknowledges the support of the ESRC Project code ES/W010259/1.","Icml Workshop on Human Interpretability in Machine Learning, (2018); Andreeva, Galina, A comparative analysis of the UK and Italian small businesses using Generalised Extreme Value models, European Journal of Operational Research, 249, 2, pp. 506-516, (2016); Apley, Daniel W., Visualizing the effects of predictor variables in black box supervised learning models, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

Examining the different types of fraud and appropriate control measures will protect the banking industry from fraudsters. In this study, we identify and classify Cyber Fraud (CF), map the severity of the fraud on a scale of priority, test the mitigation effectiveness, and propose optimal mitigation measures. The identification and classification of CF losses were based on a literature review and focus group discussions with risk and vigilance officers and cyber cell experts. The CF was analyzed using secondary data. We predicted and prioritized CF based on machine learning-derived Random Forest (RF). An efficient fraud mitigation model was developed based on an offender-victim-centric approach. Mitigation is advised both before and after fraud occurs. Through the findings of this research, banks and fraud investigators can prevent CF by detecting it quickly and controlling it on time. This study proposes a structured, sustainable CF mitigation plan that protects banks, employees, regulators, customers, and the economy, thus saving time, resources, and money.

Banking industry is trying to adopt artificial intelligence to create cyber defence system so that the unauthorized access and cyber attacks would be minimized. Banks in Qatar acknowledge the threat of cybercrimes and the role of cybersecurity in sustainable growth. Meanwhile, the banking industry is experiencing a major technological disruption. It becomes important to understand the implications of such technologies as artificial intelligence (AI) on the cybersecurity of banks. The present paper aims to explore the impacts of AI on the cybersecurity of banks in Qatar. A thematic analysis of interviews of 9 experts in the banking industry of Qatar was conducted. A qualitative thematic analysis was conducted using NVIVO 12 tool. Four key themes were identified: (1) AI is a major tool for enhancing the cybersecurity of banks in Qatar; (2) banks face challenges in using AI for improving cybersecurity; (3) AI can be used destructively and thus poses a threat to cybersecurity in banks of Qatar; (4) employed AI-based tools have vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Overall, Qatar banks can be expected to face new challenges in the future, due to changes in regulatory frameworks and increasing availability of AI-powered malware. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai Powered-malware; Artificial Intelligence; Cyberattack Patterns; Decision-making; Fin Tech; Machine Learning; Cybersecurity; Machine Learning; Malware; Network Security; Artificial Intelligence Powered-malware; Banking Industry; Cyber Security; Cyber-attacks; Cyber-defense; Cyberattack Pattern; Decisions Makings; Fin Tech; Machine-learning; Malwares; Decision Making","Cybersecurity; Machine learning; Malware; Network security; Artificial intelligence powered-malware; Banking industry; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Cyber-defense; Cyberattack pattern; Decisions makings; Fin tech; Machine-learning; Malwares; Decision making","","","The authors wish to thank, Qatar University, College of Engineering for their Guidance in coming up with the research.","Abu-Taieh, Evon M.O., Cyber security crime and punishment: Comparative study of the laws of Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and Saudi Arabia, International Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism, 8, 3, pp. 46-59, (2018); Akinbowale, Oluwatoyin Esther, Analysis of cyber-crime effects on the banking sector using the balanced score card: a survey of literature, Journal of Financial Crime, 27, 3, pp. 945-958, (2020); Alghazo, Jaafar M., Cyber security analysis of internet banking in emerging countries: User and bank perspectives, 2018-January, pp. 1-6, (2017); Al-Hamar, Yousef, Phishing attacks in Qatar: A literature review of the problems and solutions, Proceedings - International Conference on Developments in eSystems Engineering, DeSE, October-2019, pp. 837-842, (2019); International Journal of Information Systems and Management, (2018); Artificial Intelligence in Financial Industry, (2020); Successful Qualitative Research A Practical Guide for Beginners, (2013); Caldwell, M., AI-enabled future crime, Crime Science, 9, 1, (2020); Hacking Robots Before Skynet, (2017); Chowdhury, Abdullahi, Survey of recent cyber security attacks on robotic systems and their mitigation approaches, pp. 284-299, (2017)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","10876553; 01969722","","CYSYD","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136601460"

The model incorporates additional variables such as perceived playfulness and perceived usefulness, which are considered relevant to the context of chatbot adoption in the banking sector. A quantitative survey was conducted among 390 Moroccan bank customers, and the data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The results indicate that social influence, expected effort, and perceived playfulness have significant positive effects on customers' intention to use chatbots, while perceived usefulness does not. The findings also reveal that intention to use has a significant positive impact on the actual use of chatbots. Moreover, the study highlights the moderating effects of age and gender on the relationship between social influence and intention to use. The study contributes to the growing literature on chatbot adoption in the banking sector and provides valuable insights for Moroccan banks looking to enhance customer engagement through artificial intelligence.

Using monthly microdata, researchers have found that frictions in the UK’s new trade relationship with the European Union (EU) play an important part in this inflation. The trade relationship is evolving, with further changes expected in 2024. This article establishes a framework for identifying trade-related inflation in close to real time. Using programming techniques, we collect daily prices of over 100,000 supermarket items, covering 80% of the UK grocery market. We identify 1,200 products from 12 countries with a protected designation of origin (PDO). This allows us to link price changes to individual EU economies. Addressing the predominance of EU PDOs, we employ a large language model to discern product origins from additional web-scraped data, thus broadening our analysis to cover over 67,000 products. Since August 2023, we find that prices for EU-originating food products have increased at a rate of 50% higher than domestically sourced products. This study presents a unique methodological approach to dissecting food sector inflation, which is well-positioned to be used in a policy setting, allowing us to assess the possible impact of impending nontariff barriers at the GB-EU border in 2024. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Central Banking; Inflation; Llms; Prices; Trade","","","","","Anderson, Eric T., Informational rigidities and the stickiness of temporary Sales, Journal of Monetary Economics, 90, pp. 64-83, (2017); Cep Discussion Paper, (2022); Breinlich, Holger, THE BREXIT VOTE, INFLATION AND U.K. LIVING STANDARDS, International Economic Review, 63, 1, pp. 63-93, (2022); Border Target Operating Model August 2023, (2024); Cep Occasional Papers, (2021); Economics Observatory Working Paper, (2024); Dhingra, Swati, The Impact of Non-tariff Barriers on Trade and Welfare, Economica, 90, 357, pp. 140-177, (2023); undefined, (2023); Fajgelbaum, Pablo D., The Return to Protectionism, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 135, 1, pp. 1-55, (2020); Flaaen, Aaron, The production relocation and price effects of US trade policy: The case of washing machines, American Economic Review, 110, 7, pp. 2103-2127, (2020)","","Cambridge University Press","","","","","","17413036; 00279501","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003596607"

This study addresses the issue by processing customer transactions using a bank’s current account debt (CAD) product with state-of-the-art ML approaches. In the first step, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to examine the data and detect patterns and anomalies. Then, different regression methods (tree-based methods) are tested to analyze the model’s performance.

The current significance of robo-advisory to the financial sector is minor or marginal, and boils down to formulating recommendations and implementing investment strategies. However, the ongoing digital transformation of the economy leads us to believe that in the near future this technology will also be much more widely used with banking products. This makes it necessary for banks and other financial institutions to be prepared to offer this service to their customers. Purpose of the article: The aim of this paper is to identify factors significantly influencing bank customers’ intention to use robo-advisory. Identification of robo-advisory acceptance factors may increase the effectiveness of banks' promotional activities regarding such a service. Methods: Empirical data was obtained through a survey conducted on a representative sample of 911 Polish respondents aged 18–65. Using a multilevel ordered logit model and methods based on machine learning algorithms, the authors identified variables relating to the demographic and socio-economic characteristics, behaviors, and attitudes of consumers that primarily determine respondents’ adoption of robo-advisory. Findings & value added: The results of the study indicate that the variables regarding the respondents' attitude towards the use of artificial intelligence in banking services turned out to be the most important from the point of view of acceptance of robo-advisory. Next in terms of importance were the variables presenting respondents' assessments of the ethics of financial services. An important finding is that experience in using basic financial services is not a significant factor when accepting robo-advisory. From the practical perspective, the article provides recommendations on the use of artificial intelligence technology in finance and ethical aspects of the provision of such services by banks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence In Banking; Business Ethics; Financial Advisory, Machine Learning; Robo-advisory","","","","This work was supported by the National Science Centre under Grant 2019/35/B/HS4/00642 and by the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń under Grant FUTURE/07/2020.","Adamek, Jacek, Adoption factors in digital lending services offered by fintech lenders, Oeconomia Copernicana, 14, 1, pp. 169-212, (2023); Ahmed, Shamima, Artificial intelligence and machine learning in finance: A bibliometric review, Research in International Business and Finance, 61, (2022); Alsabah, Humoud, Robo-Advising: Learning Investors' Risk Preferences via Portfolio Choices, Journal of Financial Econometrics, 19, 2, pp. 369-392, (2021); Przeglad Statystyczny Statistical Review, (2021); Belanche, Daniel, Artificial Intelligence in FinTech: understanding robo-advisors adoption among customers, Industrial Management and Data Systems, 119, 7, pp. 1411-1430, (2019); Robo Advice 5 0 can Consumers Trust Robots, (2020); Breiman, Leo, Bagging predictors, Machine Learning, 24, 2, pp. 123-140, (1996); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Breiman, Leo, Classification and regression trees, pp. 1-358, (2017); Brenner, Lukas, Robo-advisors: A substitute for human financial advice?, Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance, 25, (2020)","","Institute of Economic Research","","","","","","1689765X; 23533293","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183190347"

This paper fills this gap in this area by examining whether and how increased bank competition affects export product quality. The core results of our findings are as follows. First, the statistical analysis results show that a series of bank reforms have enhanced competition in the banking industry in China. Second, the theoretical model shows that bank reform positively influences export product quality. Subsequently, employing a panel sample of 77,817 firms that exported 4,787 products (HS-6) to 230 destinations from 2000 to 2006, we adopt a difference-in-differences approach to test the association between a rise in bank competition and the quality of exported products. The baseline results which are robust in different model settings support that an increase in bank competition increases export product quality. The further empirical test shows that increased bank competition upgrades export product quality through the following channels: bank competition increase leads to enterprises' financial stability enhancement which, in turn, leads to R&D investment upgrading which then leads to export product quality enhancement. Finally, the heterogeneity checks documented that the positive effect of bank competition upgrading on export product quality is pronounced for non-SOEs, and for firms in both the growth and mature stages. Moreover, an increase in bank competition makes financial resources more accessible in areas with weak financial infrastructure. Our findings shed light on the policy implications for emerging economies. Our study expands the theoretical framework of bank competition research on export product quality and inspires the development of strategies for exporting enterprises. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Competition In The Banking Industry; Difference-in-difference; Export Product Quality; Machine Learning; R&d Investment","","","","","Abbas, Faisal, Dynamics of diversification and banks' risk-taking and stability: Empirical analysis of commercial banks, Managerial and Decision Economics, 43, 4, pp. 1000-1014, (2022); Abbas, Faisal, Bank Capital Buffer and Economic Growth: New Insights from the US Banking Sector, Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 14, 4, (2021); Abbas, Faisal, IMPACT OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND ITS SUBCOMPONENTS ON COMMERCIAL BANKS' RISK-TAKING, Annals of Financial Economics, 17, 3, (2022); Abbas, Faisal, ECONOMICS OF RISK-TAKING, RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND PROFITABILITY: EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE OF ISLAMIC BANKS, Asian Academy of Management Journal of Accounting and Finance, 18, 1, pp. 1-31, (2022); Managing Corporate Lifecycles, (2004); Journal of Business Economics, (2019); Ali, Shoaib, Role of bank competition in determining liquidity creation: evidence from GCC countries, Journal of Applied Economics, 25, 1, pp. 242-259, (2022); Amos, Sanday, Financial constraints, firm productivity and cross-country income differences: Evidence from sub-Sahara Africa, Borsa Istanbul Review, 19, 4, pp. 357-371, (2019); Review of Economics and Statistics, (2013); Amore, Mario Daniele, Credit supply and corporate innovation, Journal of Financial Economics, 109, 3, pp. 835-855, (2013)","","World Scientific","","","","","","20104952; 20104960","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189096372"

The models are applied to a unique and proprietary dataset comprising granular firm-level quarterly data collected from a European investment bank and an international insurance company on a sample of 464 Italian SMBs over the period 2015–2017. Results show that the HRF approach outperforms the traditional ordered probit model, highlighting how advanced estimation methodologies that use machine learning techniques can be successfully implemented to predict SMB credit risk, i.e. when facing high asymmetries of information. Moreover, by using Shapley values, we are able to assess the relevance of each variable in predicting SMB credit risk. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Credit Rating; Historical Random Forest; Invoice Lending; Machine Learning; Relationship Banking; Smb; Banking; Empirical Analysis; Insurance Industry; Investment; Machine Learning; Small And Medium-sized Enterprise; Italy","banking; empirical analysis; insurance industry; investment; machine learning; small and medium-sized enterprise; Italy","","","Funding text 1: This research has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program “PERISCOPE: Pan European Response to the ImpactS of COvid-19 and future Pandemics and Epidemics”, under the Grant Agreement No. 101016233, H2020-SC1-PHE-CORONAVIRUS-2020-2-RTD.; Funding text 2: This research has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program “PERISCOPE: Pan European Response to the ImpactS of COvid-19 and future Pandemics and Epidemics” , under the Grant Agreement No. 101016233 , H2020-SC1-PHE-CORONAVIRUS-2020-2-RTD .","International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards A Revised Framework, (2004); Cucinelli, Doriana, Credit risk in European banks: The bright side of the internal ratings based approach, Journal of Banking and Finance, 93, pp. 213-229, (2018); Altman, Edward I., Commercial Bank Lending: Process, Credit Scoring, and Costs of Errors in Lending, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 15, 4, pp. 813-832, (1980); Louzada, Francisco, Classification methods applied to credit scoring: Systematic review and overall comparison, Surveys in Operations Research and Management Science, 21, 2, pp. 117-134, (2016); Blöchlinger, Andreas, Are Ratings the Worst Form of Credit Assessment Except for All the Others?, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 53, 1, pp. 299-334, (2018); Journal of Business, (1995); Claessens, Stijn, The basel II reform and retail credit markets, Journal of Financial Services Research, 28, 1-3, pp. 5-13, (2005); Financing Smes and Entrepreneurs an OECD Scoreboard Special Edition the Impact of Covid 19, (2020); Kysucky, Vlado, The benefits of relationship lending in a cross-country context: A meta-analysis, Management Science, 62, 1, pp. 90-110, (2016); Casu, Barbara, Access to Credit in a Market Downturn, Journal of Financial Services Research, 66, 2, pp. 143-169, (2024)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","00380121","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178218075"

Machine Learning (ML) models are also being used to make predictions in these applications. Accurate forecasting requires knowledge of these machine learning models and their distinguishing features. The datasets we use as input for each of these different types of ML models, yielding different results. The choice of an ML model for a dataset is critical. A loan risk model is used to show how ML models for a dataset can be linked together. The purpose of this study is to look into how we could use machine learning to quantify or forecast mortgage credit risk. This phrase refers to the process of evaluating massive amounts of data in order to derive useful information for making decisions in a variety of fields. If credit risk is considered, a method based on an examination of what caused and how mortgage credit risk affected credit defaults during the still-current economic crisis of 2021 will be tried. Various approaches to credit risk calculation will be examined, ranging from the most basic to the most complex.

G. Department of Commerce, Magadh University, Bodh Gaya, India","Artificial Intelligence (AI) has proved its significance in every field and is yet to be explored in the banking sector in India. The study aims to understand the customers' perception of using AI-based technologies in banks. Satisfaction is the first step towards acceptability and retention of customers towards lesser-known technology and automated process implemented in banks. The constructs of the study are referred from the technology acceptance model to define their level of acceptance and are divided into independent and dependent variables. The independent variables are “transparency”, “awareness level”, “security”, “efficiency”, “trust”, and “social influence”, and the dependent variable is “customer satisfaction”. Therefore, the structural equation model was developed from the customers’ (N = 500) response to retail banks in northern India. The study reveals that trust is the most significant factor for greater customers' satisfaction towards AI-enabled technologies in banks, followed by the customers’ awareness level. The security of AI-based banks is the least important contributor to customer satisfaction. Additionally, the control variables, i.e., age and gender, govern the customers' perception. Understanding customer acceptability towards AI-based technology in retail banks is rare in emerging nations such as India. The findings provide insight into the formulation of compliance. It also highlights the regulation applicable to digital banks by the competent authority in India. The paper concludes by stating practical implications for banking authorities and decision-makers to incorporate AI into their system for customer service. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Banking Industry; Customer Acceptance; Partial Least Square; Structural Equation Modelling; Technology Acceptance Model","","","","","Abdulquadri, Abdulazeez Olamide, Digital transformation in financial services provision: a Nigerian perspective to the adoption of chatbot, Journal of Enterprising Communities, 15, 2, pp. 258-281, (2021); Abikari, Masoome, Negative emotions and consumer behavioural intention to adopt emerging e-banking technology, Journal of Financial Services Marketing, 28, 4, pp. 691-704, (2023); Adam, Martin, AI-based chatbots in customer service and their effects on user compliance, Electronic Markets, 31, 2, pp. 427-445, (2021); Agarwal, Pragati, Artificial Intelligence Adoption in the Post COVID-19 New-Normal and Role of Smart Technologies in Transforming Business: a Review, Journal of Science and Technology Policy Management, 15, 3, pp. 506-529, (2024); Ahmadi Danyali, Arezo, Factors influencing customers’ change of behaviors from online banking to mobile banking in Tejarat Bank, Iran, Journal of Organizational Change Management, 31, 6, pp. 1226-1233, (2018); Aitken, Mhairi, In pursuit of socially-minded data-intensive innovation in banking: A focus group study of public expectations of digital innovation in banking, Technology in Society, 66, (2021); Arif, Imtiaz, Barriers in adoption of internet banking: A structural equation modeling - Neural network approach, Technology in Society, 61, (2020); Auh, Seigyoung, When Does Customer Participation Matter?

AI is a critical way of facilitating user acceptance and adoption of mobile banking applications (apps). Nevertheless, the ways in which AI features influence users’ continuance intention towards AI-enabled mobile banking apps have not been investigated from the perspective of an expectation confirmation model (ECM). To address this research gap, this paper develops a research model by combining two constructs pertaining to AI characteristics, namely, perceived intelligence and perceived anthropomorphism, and by using the ECM to explore users’ continuance intentions in this context. We employed a survey research method using a random sampling approach to collect 365 valid responses. A partial least squares approach was used to examine the model. The results show that both intelligence and anthropomorphism can increase user satisfaction via confirmation and perceived usefulness, which in turn fosters users’ willingness to continue to engage in mobile banking. This paper offers theoretical advancements, discusses future directions for mobile banking research and provides practical guidance to app developers with respect to designing and developing proper mobile banking apps using AI technology. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This research is supported by the College Students’ Innovation and Entrepreneurship project (grant number: 202113177001 and S202113177016).","Albashrawi, Mousa, Privacy and Personalization in Continued Usage Intention of Mobile Banking: An Integrative Perspective, Information Systems Frontiers, 21, 5, pp. 1031-1043, (2019); Journal of Information Technology Research, (2021); Ali, Ahsan, Exploring factors affecting mobile-banking app adoption: a perspective from adaptive structuration theory, Aslib Journal of Information Management, 75, 4, pp. 773-795, (2023); Journal of Marketing Research, (1977); Review of Socionetwork Strategies, (2020); Baabdullah, Abdullah Mohammed A., Consumer use of mobile banking (M-Banking) in Saudi Arabia: Towards an integrated model, International Journal of Information Management, 44, pp. 38-52, (2019); Balakrishnan, Janarthanan, Conversational commerce: entering the next stage of AI-powered digital assistants, Annals of Operations Research, 333, 2-3, pp. 653-687, (2024); Banerjee, Shubhomoy, Examining the role of customers' intrinsic motivation on continued usage of mobile banking: a relational approach, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 40, 1, pp. 87-109, (2022); Barta, Sergio, Using augmented reality to reduce cognitive dissonance and increase purchase intention, Computers in Human Behavior, 140, (2023); Bhattacherjee, Anol, Understanding information systems continuance: An expectation-confirmation model, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 25, 3, pp. 351-370, (2001)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","26629992","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161978672"

However, does this bold innovation truly resonate with consumers? This study delves into consumer intentions to adopt open banking in Indonesia by leveraging the technology readiness model, scrutinising its antecedents and moderating factors, and identifying the key attributes that users anticipate. Design/methodology/approach: Through quantitative and qualitative approaches, this study answers the following questions: (1) Are financial service users ready to use open banking/open API applications? (2) What are the key attributes that consumer expects of open banking/open API? First, the authors developed a structural model based on the technology readiness model, distributed the questionnaire in eight major cities in Indonesia, analysed it using PLS-SEM and utilised a machine learning approach to unpack the main attributes expected from open banking. Findings: This study’s findings indicate that customers are generally prepared to embrace open banking innovations. Nonetheless, to enhance public acceptance, certain factors should be emphasised, including organisational support, user-friendly technology, a comprehensive range of features, consumer financial literacy and banks' readiness to adopt open banking. In contrast to prior research, this study reveals that loyalty to traditional banking positively moderates the connection between customer value and the intention to utilise open banking. Additionally, the authors did not observe a significant moderating effect of financial literacy on the relationship between perceived customer value and the intention to use open banking. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is one of the few that comprehensively analyses the consumers' readiness for open banking in developing contexts.

Design/methodology/approach: The qualitative research was carried out using in-depth interviews from officials in the baking industry to understand the importance and challenges of adopting AI in the banking industry. In the quantitative study, a total of 302 completed questionnaires were received from Malaysian banking customers. The data were analysed using the SmartPLS 3.0 software to identify the important predictors of their intention to adopt AI. Findings: The qualitative results reveal that AI is an essential tool for fraud detection and risk prevention. The absence of regulatory requirements, data privacy and security, and lack of relevant skills and IT infrastructure are significant challenges of AI adoption. The quantitative results indicate that attitude towards AI, perceived usefulness, perceived risk, perceived trust, and subjective norms significantly influence intention to adopt AI in banking services while perceived ease of use and awareness do not. The results also show that attitude towards AI significantly mediates the relationship between perceived usefulness and intention to adopt AI in banking services. Practical implications: Financial technology (FinTech) is regarded as a critical determinant of strategic planning in the banking industry. While AI provides various disruptive opportunities in the FinTech space in terms of data collection, analysis, safeguarding and streamlining processes, it also poses a sea of threats to incumbent banks. This study provides vital insights for the policymakers of the banking industry to address the challenges of adopting AI in banking.

The factors that could increase credit risk are non-performing assets and frauds which are improved by continuous monitoring of payments and other assessment patterns. In past years, few statistical and manual auditing methods were investigated which were not much suitable for tremendous amount of data. Thus, the growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with efficient access to big data is focused. However, the effective Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques are introduced to improve the performance and issues in banking and finance sectors by concentrating the business process and customer interaction. In this review, it mainly focusses on the different learning methods-based research articles available in recent years. This review also considers 93 recent research articles that were available in the last 5 years related to the topic of credit risk with different learning methods to tackle traditional challenges. Thus, these advances can make the banking process as smart and fast while preserving themselves from credit defaulters. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Banking And Finance Sectors; Credit Risk; Deep Learning; Hybrid Approaches; Machine Learning; Deep Learning; Finance; Learning Systems; Banking And Finance; Banking And Finance Sector; Banking Sectors; Credit Risk Assessment; Credit Risks; Critical Problems; Hybrid Approach; Learning Methods; Machine-learning; Risk Assessment","Deep learning; Finance; Learning systems; Banking and finance; Banking and finance sector; Banking sectors; Credit risk assessment; Credit risks; Critical problems; Hybrid approach; Learning methods; Machine-learning; Risk assessment","","","Funding This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.","Doko, Fisnik, Credit Risk Model Based on Central Bank Credit Registry Data, Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 14, 3, (2021); Yanenkova, Iryna G., Modeling of Bank Credit Risk Management Using the Cost Risk Model, Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 14, 5, (2021); Mhlanga, David, Financial inclusion in emerging economies: The application of machine learning and artificial intelligence in credit risk assessment, International Journal of Financial Studies, 9, 3, (2021); Du, Guansan, Application of innovative risk early warning mode under big data technology in Internet credit financial risk assessment, Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, 386, (2021); Caruso, Giulia, Cluster Analysis for mixed data: An application to credit risk evaluation, Socio-Economic Planning Sciences, 73, (2021); Wen, Chunhui, Big data driven Internet of Things for credit evaluation and early warning in finance, Future Generation Computer Systems, 124, pp. 295-307, (2021); Bussmann, Niklas, Explainable Machine Learning in Credit Risk Management, Computational Economics, 57, 1, pp. 203-216, (2021); Mowbray, Max R., Industrial data science - a review of machine learning applications for chemical and process industries, Reaction Chemistry and Engineering, 7, 7, pp. 1471-1509, (2022); Han, Chaoliang, Optimization of supply chain efficiency management based on machine learning and neural network, Neural Computing and Applications, 33, 5, pp. 1419-1433, (2021); Guo, Yitong, Adaptively Promoting Diversity in a Novel Ensemble Method for Imbalanced Credit-Risk Evaluation, Mathematics, 10, 11, (2022)","","IOS Press BV","","","","","","18724981; 18758843","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177806685"

The issue of NPLs has been linked to corruption, which has emerged as one of the contributing factors. Given the scarcity of research on the use of machine learning (ML) techniques to examine the relationship between corruption and NPLs, this paper provides an empirical evaluation of various ML algorithms for predicting NPLs. Besides ML performance comparisons, this paper presents the analysis of ML features importance to justify the effect of corruption factor in the different ML algorithms for predicting NPLs. The results indicated that most of the tested ML algorithms present good ability in the prediction models at accuracy percentages above 70% but corruption index has contributed very minimal effect to the ML performances. The most outperformed ML algorithm in the different proposed settings is random forest. The framework of this research is highly reproducible to be extended with a more in-depth analysis, particularly on problems of NPL as well as on the ML algorithms. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking Institution; Corruption; Machine Learning; Malaysia; Non-performing Loan","","","","The authors would like to thanks the Universiti Poly-Tech Malaysia, grant code: 100-TNCPI/PRI 16/6/2 (058/2022) and Accounting Research Institute (HICoE) and Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia for providing the necessary financial assistance for this study.","Singh, Sanju Kumar, The Effect of Non-Performing Loan on Profitability: Empirical Evidence from Nepalese Commercial Banks, Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business, 8, 4, pp. 709-716, (2021); Orlando, Giuseppe, Non-performing loans for Italian companies: When time matters. an empirical research on estimating probability to default and loss given default, International Journal of Financial Studies, 8, 4, pp. 1-22, (2020); Kuzucu, Narman, What Drives Non-Performing Loans?

Although experimental exploration of persistent seed banks yields valuable insights, it is often time-consming, labor-intensive, and costly. Consequently, the development of efficient computational methods like machine learning techniques is crucial to augment traditional fieldwork and enhance our capacity for effective seed bank data analysis and interpretation. In this study, we collated a dataset of 398 observations from the TRY database, encompassing measurements such as seed thickness, seed length, seed width, seed dry mass, and seed bank type. Notably, some species' seed bank types within this dataset are identified as having a soil seed bank, without distinguishing between persistent or transient seed banks. Our primary objective was to utilize this data to predict whether a species' soil seed bank is persistent or transient. To this end, we evaluated the performance of four classic machine learning methods—Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—in predicting seed bank types. We gauged the performance of each model using five metrics: Accuracy, AUC (Area Under the Curve), kappa, sensitivity, and specificity. Among the four models examined, the ANN model proved to be the most effective in predicting the persistence of soil seed banks, suggesting its efficacy in predicting seed bank types based on a limited number of independent variables. This study underscores the potential of machine learning methods in soil seed bank research and paves the way for future investigations. It can potentially aid in crafting conservation strategies by enhancing our understanding of plant population dynamics. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classification; Cross-validation; Machine Learning; Roc (receiver Operating Characteristic); Seed Bank Type; Artificial Neural Network; Data Set; Exploration; Fieldwork; Life History; Machine Learning; Persistence; Seed Bank; Support Vector Machine","artificial neural network; data set; exploration; fieldwork; life history; machine learning; persistence; seed bank; support vector machine","","","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 31870709 ), Scientific Research Funding Project of the Education Department of Liaoning Province ( LJKZ0103 ), and the Opening Fund of Key Laboratory of Natural Disaster Monitoring, Early Warning and Assessment of Jiangxi Province ( Jiangxi Normal University , JXZRZH202302 ).

This study contributes to the banking literature and practice in two ways by (a) proposing a risk ranking index based on the Mahalanobis Distance (MD) between a multidimensional point representing a bank’s risk measures and the corresponding critical ratios set by the banking authorities and (b) determining the relative importance of a bank’s risk ratios in affecting its financial standing using an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System. In this study, ten financial ratios representing five risk areas were considered, namely: Capital Adequacy, Credit, Liquidity, Earning Quality, and Operational risk. Data from 45 Gulf banks for the period 2016–2020 was used to develop the model. Our findings indicate that a bank is in a sound risk position at the 99%, 95%, and 90% confidence level if its Mahalanobis distance exceeds 4.82, 4.28, and 4.0, respectively. The maximum distance computed for the banks in this study was 9.31; only five out of the forty-five banks were below the 4.82 and one below the 4.28 and 4.0 thresholds at 3.96. Sensitivity analysis of the risks indicated that the Net Interest Margin is the most significant factor in explaining variations in a bank’s risk position, followed by Capital Adequacy Ratio, Common Equity Tier1, and Tier1 Equity in order. The remaining financial ratios: Non-Performing Loans, Equity Leverage, Cost Income Ratio, Loans to Total Assets, and Loans to Deposits have the least influence in the order given; the Provisional Loans Ratio appears to have no influence. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Banking Risk Index; Gcc Banks; Neuro-fuzzy Systems; Finance; Fuzzy Inference; Fuzzy Neural Networks; Fuzzy Systems; Sensitivity Analysis; Adaptive Neural Networks; Banking Risk Index; Banking Risks; Capital Adequacies; Financial Ratios; Gcc Bank; Mahalanobis Distances; Neural-network-based Fuzzy Inference Systems; Neurofuzzy System; Risk Indices; Risk Assessment","Finance; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Sensitivity analysis; Adaptive neural networks; Banking risk index; Banking risks; Capital adequacies; Financial ratios; GCC bank; Mahalanobis distances; Neural-network-based fuzzy inference systems; Neurofuzzy system; Risk indices; Risk assessment","","","This work was financially supported by Ajman University under IRG: 2021-IGR-CBA-8.","Aly, Samar, Bankruptcy Prediction Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques: A Survey, Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, 224, pp. 335-360, (2022); Foundations of Banking Risk an Overview of Banking Banking Risks and Risk Based Banking Regulation, (2009); Babaei, Golnoosh, A neural-network-based decision-making model in the peer-to-peer lending market, Intelligent Systems in Accounting, Finance and Management, 27, 3, pp. 142-150, (2020); Bai, Runbo, Factor sensitivity analysis with neural network simulation based on perturbation system, Journal of Computers, 6, 7, pp. 1402-1407, (2011); Annual Report, (2025); Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, (2011); International Journal of Innovation Creativity and Change, (2020); Brlecic Valcic, Sonja, Utilisation of anfis in analysing impact of cost structure on croatian maritime companies development, Pomorstvo, 35, 1, pp. 179-185, (2021); Oxford University Press, (2014); Artificial Neural Networks Models and Applications, (2016)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","15737462; 02692821","","AIRVE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153349355"

This paper employs a series of machine learning techniques to forecast bank nonperforming loans on emerging countries' financial institutions. Using quarterly cross-sectional data of 322 banks from 15 emerging countries, this study finds that advanced machine learning-based models outperform simple linear techniques in forecasting bank nonperforming loans. Among all 14 linear and nonlinear models, the random forest model outperforms other models. It achieves a 76.10% accuracy in forecasting nonperforming loans. The result is robust in different performance metrics. The variable importance analysis reveals that bank diversification is the most critical determinant for future nonperforming loans of a bank. Additionally, this study revealed that macroeconomic factors are less prominent in predicting nonperforming loans compared with bank-specific factors. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bagged Cart; Banking; Forecasting; Machine Learning; Nonperforming Loans (npls); Machine Learning; Bagged Cart; Bank Non-performing Loans; Emerging Countries; Financial Institution; Learning Based Models; Machine Learning Techniques; Machine-learning; Nonperforming Loan; Performance; Simplest Linear; Forecasting","Machine learning; Bagged CART; Bank non-performing loans; Emerging countries; Financial institution; Learning Based Models; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Nonperforming loan; Performance; Simplest linear; Forecasting","","","","Abdullah, Mohammad, The implication of machine learning for financial solvency prediction: an empirical analysis on public listed companies of Bangladesh, Journal of Asian Business and Economic Studies, 28, 4, pp. 303-320, (2021); Akyildirim, Erdinç, Forecasting mid-price movement of Bitcoin futures using machine learning, Annals of Operations Research, 330, 1-2, pp. 553-584, (2023); Altman, Naomi Simone, An introduction to kernel and nearest-neighbor nonparametric regression, American Statistician, 46, 3, pp. 175-185, (1992); Archer, Kellie J., Empirical characterization of random forest variable importance measures, Computational Statistics and Data Analysis, 52, 4, pp. 2249-2260, (2008); Arham, Nurfilzah, Impact of macroeconomic cyclical indicators and country governance on bank non-performing loans in Emerging Asia, Eurasian Economic Review, 10, 4, pp. 707-726, (2020); Ashraf, Badar Nadeem, Economic policy uncertainty and banks’ loan pricing, Journal of Financial Stability, 44, (2019); Baker, Scott R., Measuring economic policy uncertainty, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 131, 4, pp. 1593-1636, (2016); Bashir, Usman, Do banking system transparency and competition affect nonperforming loans in the Chinese banking sector?, Applied Economics Letters, 24, 21, pp. 1519-1525, (2017); Bauer, Eric, Empirical comparison of voting classification algorithms: bagging, boosting, and variants, Machine Learning, 36, 1, pp. 105-139, (1999); Berger, Allen N., Problem loans and cost efficiency in commercial banks, Journal of Banking and Finance, 21, 6, pp. 849-870, (1997)","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","","","","","1099131X; 02776693","","JOFOD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152041605"

Understanding the customer is necessary for providing services and products to the customer in accordance with his preferences and requirements. Client division and profiling are essential in accomplishing two principal goals of CRM (Customer Relationship Management) i.e.; client maintenance and client advancement. Under CRM, loans are the most important product that banks and other financial institutions offer to meet customers' needs, but determining which customers are eligible for loans is a significant challenge. However, loans come with a risk of default, or the possibility that some borrowers will not be able to repay the loans they have been given. As a result, banks that have a lot of non-performing loans may go bankrupt or become unstable as a result. The progression of innovation like artificial intelligence (AI), getting helpful data from client information is of central significance in nowadays. By developing, comparing, and testing the accuracy of various models using datasets from two banks, we contribute to commercial banks' efforts to predict borrowers' behaviors. Throughout the manuscript, the first dataset is referred to as Dataset-1, and the second dataset is referred to as Dataset-2. In order to determine which machine learning method is most effective for predicting bank loan default, base learners, ensemble, and voting are used. The results demonstrate that Random forest (RF) outperformed all other classifiers. Precision, recall, the f1-score, and the ROC (AUC) curve all supported the classifiers' findings.

One area where they have not been readily deployed is the estimation of frontiers. The literature on frontier estimation has seen its share of research comparing and contrasting data envelopment analysis (DEA) and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA), the two workhorse estimators. These studies rely on both Monte Carlo experiments and actual data sets to examine a range of performance issues which can be used to elucidate insights on the benefits or weaknesses of one method over the other. As can be imagined, neither method is universally better than the other. The present paper proposes an alternative approach that is quite flexible in terms of functional form and distributional assumptions and it amalgamates the benefits of both DEA and SFA. Specifically, we bridge these two popular approaches via Bayesian artificial neural networks while accounting for possible endogeneity of inputs. We examine the performance of this new machine learning approach using Monte Carlo experiments which is found to be very good, comparable to, or often better than, the current standards in the literature. To illustrate the new techniques, we provide an application of this approach to a data set of large US banks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking; Bayesian Artificial Neural Networks; Efficiency Analysis; Flexible Functional Forms; Machine Learning; Simulation; Bayesian Networks; Data Envelopment Analysis; Efficiency; Monte Carlo Methods; Neural Networks; Stochastic Systems; Bayesian Artificial Neural Networks; Data Set; Efficiency Analysis; Flexible Functional Form; Functional Forms; Machine-learning; Monte Carlo Experiments; Power; Simulation; Stochastic Frontier Analysis; Machine Learning","Bayesian networks; Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Monte Carlo methods; Neural networks; Stochastic systems; Bayesian artificial neural networks; Data set; Efficiency analysis; Flexible functional form; Functional forms; Machine-learning; Monte Carlo experiments; Power; Simulation; Stochastic frontier analysis; Machine learning","","","This paper was previously circulated under the title “Bridging the Divide?

However, there is a lag in access to decent housing in Mexico and the lack of credit history is a limiting factor for access to bank loans. The objective of this research is to analyze mortgage credit selection criteria and propose a risk management model that allows banks to finance a greater number of people in the acquisition or improvement of their homes. The methodological strategy is based on machine learning techniques supported by data science to create a predictive model of credit fulfillment based on individual characteristics. The results show a predictive model of risk discrimination with a reliability of 85% for housing loans, which allows expanding the potential base of people susceptible to access mortgage financing. The right to decent housing presents a significant backlog in the country and so far the banks, by proposing a predictive model of mortgage risk selection, provide an answer to the research question that refers to the actions that can be taken by the banks to solve the problem of lack of access to decent housing. Banks can establish their risk selection criteria supported by data science and analytics and the application of predictive machine learning models using their extensive database. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decent Housing; Machine Learning; Risk Selection Criteria; Social Mobility; Banking; Housing; Machine Learning; Modeling; Mortgage Lending; Risk Assessment; Social Mobility; Mexico [north America]","banking; housing; machine learning; modeling; mortgage lending; risk assessment; social mobility; Mexico [North America]","","","","Addo, Peter Martey, Credit risk analysis using machine and deep learning models, Risks, 6, 2, (2018); 5cs of Credit in the Lending Industry, (2011); Fintech in Financial Inclusion Machine Learning Applications in Assessing Credit Risk, (2019); IMF Working Paper Wp 09 109, (2009); El Sistema Financiero Mexicano Diagnostico Y Recomendaciones, (2017); Journal of Business Research, (2019); Cnbv, (2020); Sistema Nacional De Informacion En Salud, (2016); undefined, (2021); Precios De La Vivienda En Mexico, (2021)","","Universidad del Zulia","","","","","","13159984","","","","Spanish","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171747592"

The authors develop an inexpensive method for extending survey data when frequent, universal surveys are unavailable. The authors identify groups of country characteristics that influence LPI scores. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from the World Development Indicators—the broadest global dataset of country socioeconomic features—the authors test machine learning algorithms for their ability to predict the LPI. The authors examine importance scores to identify factors that influence LPI scores. Findings: The best performing algorithm produces predictions on unseen data that account for nearly 90% of observed variation, and are accurate to within 6%. It performs twice as well as an OLS model with per capita income as the only predictor. Explanatory factors are business environment, economic structure, finance, environment, human development, and institutional quality. Practical implications: Machine learning offers a simple, inexpensive way of extending the coverage of survey data. This dataset provides a richer picture of logistics performance around the world. The factors the authors identify as predicting higher LPI scores can help policymakers and practitioners target interventions. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first applications of machine learning to extend coverage of an index based on an international survey. The authors use the new data to provide the most wide-ranging analysis of logistics performance across countries and over time. The output is an important resource for policymakers tracking performance, and researchers particularly in smaller and lower income countries. The authors also examine a wider range of explanatory factors for LPI scores than previous work. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Determinants Of Performance; Logistics; Machine Learning; Prediction","","","","","Connecting to Compete Trade Logistics in the Global Economy, (2010); Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B, (1964); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Ifc Bulletin, (2017); Card, David E., Minimum wages and employment: a case study of the fast-food industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, American Economic Review, 84, 4, pp. 772-793, (1994); Cengiz, Doruk, The Effect of Minimum Wages on Low-Wage Jobs*, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 134, 3, pp. 1405-1454, (2019); Cortes, Corinna, Support-Vector Networks, Machine Learning, 20, 3, pp. 273-297, (1995); Engblom, Janne R.K., Multiple-method analysis of logistics costs, International Journal of Production Economics, 137, 1, pp. 29-35, (2012); Gründler, Klaus, Corruption and economic growth: New empirical evidence, European Journal of Political Economy, 60, (2019); Elements of Statistical Learning, (2001)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","09600035","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158850500"

From another point of view, the design of services according to the customer’s needs will require a careful examination of the data related to the customer in different dimensions. Therefore, knowing the customer requires a systematic approach in order to identify the goals, influencing factors, algorithms and methods suitable for this field. The upcoming research has analyzed the dimensions of customer recognition in the banking industry and its considerations with a data-oriented approach and the application of machine learning. The research method is applied according to the purpose and is meta-synthesis according to the collection of information. To select articles, 43 documents published in the period of 2016-2022 were identified as relevant and valid documents by searching in the reliable databases of Web of Science and Scopus, and further, with a meta-synthesis approach they were studied and coded. The results of meta-synthesis led to the identification of three main categories: 1) customer identification objectives: understanding customer insight, identifying customer risk, organizational goals, determining customer lifetime value and product management, 2) customer identification factors: demographic, financial and behavioral and, 3) machine learning algorithms: Probabilistic, Neural Networks, Ensemble, Regularization, Regression, Bayesian, Decision Tree, Dimensionality Reduction, Instanced Based and Clustering. Based on the findings of the current research, according to the purpose of customer identification, available data and selected factors, basic and combined algorithms can be a way forward, but the important point is accurate data pre-processing. Another point is that no distinction has been made between real and legal customers, and most studies have focused on real customers, which can be attributed to the complexity of the chain of financial interactions of legal customers. Also, considering the banks’ lack of emphasis on branches regarding the need to complete the information contained in the account opening forms or the lack of designing a suitable service to complete the information on electronic platforms, a more accurate understanding of the customer requires a review of these processes. It is worth mentioning that in none of the studies, customer recognition was done using only demographic factors, and depending on the purpose of the study, the factors were used in combination. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking Industry; Customer Identification Factors; Customer Recognition; Machine Learning; Meta-synthesis","","","","","Abbasimehr, Hossein, A new methodology for customer behavior analysis using time series clustering: A case study on a bank’s customers, Kybernetes, 50, 2, pp. 221-242, (2021); International Journal of Management Perspective, (2014); Alam, Talha Mahboob, An investigation of credit card default prediction in the imbalanced datasets, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 201173-201198, (2020); Ala’raj, Maher, Classifiers consensus system approach for credit scoring, Knowledge-Based Systems, 104, pp. 89-105, (2016); Ala’raj, Maher, Modelling customers credit card behaviour using bidirectional LSTM neural networks, Journal of Big Data, 8, 1, (2021); Al-Qerem, Ahmad H., Default prediction model: The significant role of data engineering in the quality of outcomes, International Arab Journal of Information Technology, 17, 4 Special Issue, pp. 635-644, (2020); Al-Rubaiee, Hamed, Tuning of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) via Customer Experience Management (CEM) using sentiment analysis on aspects level, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 9, 5, pp. 300-312, (2018); Arli, Denni I., Investigating consumer ethics: a segmentation study, Journal of Consumer Marketing, 34, 7, pp. 636-645, (2017); Ashofteh, Afshin, A conservative approach for online credit scoring, Expert Systems with Applications, 176, (2021); Atkins, Salla Aija A., Conducting a meta-ethnography of qualitative literature: Lessons learnt, BMC Medical Research Methodology, 8, (2008)","","Iranian Research Institute for Scientific Information and Documentation","","","","","","22518231; 22518223","","","","Persian","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180998432"

Content analysis is used to analyze the spread of AI and related information in the annual report textual data. Based on content analysis and regression analysis of data from 115 annual reports for 15 Jordanian banks listed in the Amman Stock Exchange for the period 2014 to 2021, the study reveals a consistent increase in the mention of AI-related terms disclosure since 2014. However, the level of AI-related disclosure remains weak for some banks, suggesting that Jordanian banks are still in the early stages of adopting and implementing AI technologies. The results indicate that AI-related keywords disclosure has an influence on banks’ financial performance. AI has a positive effect on accounting performance in terms of ROA and ROE and a negative impact on total expenses, which supports the dominant view that AI improves revenue and reduces cost and is also consistent with past literature findings. This study contributes to the growing body of AI literature, specifically the literature on AI voluntary disclosure, in several aspects. First, it provides an objective measure of the uses of AI by formulating an AI disclosure index that captures the status of AI adoption in practice. Second, it provides insights into the relationship between AI disclosure and financial performance. Third, it supports policymakers’, international authorities’, and supervisory organizations’ efforts to address AI disclosure issues and highlights the need for disclosure guidance requirements. Finally, it provides a contribution to banking sector practitioners who are transforming their operations using AI mechanisms and supports the need for more AI disclosure and informed decision making in a manner that aligns with the objectives of financial institutions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Banking Sector; Content Analysis; Financial Performance; Jordanian Banks; Voluntary Disclosure","","","","","Abdallah, Abed Al Nasser, Corporate governance practices, ownership structure, and corporate performance in the GCC countries, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 46, pp. 98-115, (2017); International Journal of Business Ethics in Developing Economies, (2020); Albitar, Khaldoon, ESG disclosure and firm performance before and after IR: The moderating role of governance mechanisms, International Journal of Accounting and Information Management, 28, 3, pp. 429-444, (2020); Alcácer, V., Scanning the Industry 4.0: A Literature Review on Technologies for Manufacturing Systems, Engineering Science and Technology, an International Journal, 22, 3, pp. 899-919, (2019); Al-Gamrh, Bakr, The impact of board independence and foreign ownership on financial and social performance of firms: evidence from the UAE, Journal of Applied Accounting Research, 21, 2, pp. 201-229, (2020); Alkaraan, Fadi, Corporate transformation toward Industry 4.0 and financial performance: The influence of environmental, social, and governance (ESG), Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 175, (2022); Al-Malkawi, Husam Aldin Nizar, Corporate governance practices in emerging markets: The case of GCC countries, Economic Modelling, 38, pp. 133-141, (2014); Almustafa, Hamza, The impact of COVID-19 on firm risk and performance in MENA countries: Does national governance quality matter?, PLOS ONE, 18, 2 February, (2023); An, Yi, Towards a comprehensive theoretical framework for voluntary IC disclosure, Journal of Intellectual Capital, 12, 4, pp. 571-585, (2011); Anastasi, Sara, Implications of embedded artificial intelligence - Machine learning on safety of machinery, Procedia Computer Science, 180, pp. 338-343, (2021)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","22277072","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172926472"

To improve the efficiency of anti-phishing techniques, we present an improved predictive model based on machine learning. The proposed method uses six different algorithms; Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The experiments are based on a public dataset of 58,000 legitimate websites and 30,647 phishing ones, including 112 attributes for each sample. Our evaluations in the feature selection process show that after balancing the dataset and dropping constant features, a noticeable improvement can be achieved. We conducted our evaluation found on eight major unique scenarios. The experimental results of our phishing websites detection (PWD) method indicate remarkable performances in which each algorithm reached an accuracy of more than 93%, and the XGBoost classifier outperforms others with 99.2% overall accuracy, 99.1% precision, 99.4% recall, and 99.1% specificity. In addition, the study achieved optimal run-time of about 1500 ms for the XGBoost algorithm without dimension reduction while using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces it down to just 869 ms. As a result, the proposed approach would be practical in both offline and real-time applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classification; Cyber Security; Machine Learning; Phishing Website Detection; Xgboost; Adaptive Boosting; Balancing; Computer Crime; Cybersecurity; Electronic Commerce; Principal Component Analysis; Support Vector Machines; Websites; Cyber Security; Detection Methods; E- Commerces; E-banking; High-accuracy; Machine-learning; On-machines; Phishing Website Detection; Phishing Websites; Xgboost; Nearest Neighbor Search","Adaptive boosting; Balancing; Computer crime; Cybersecurity; Electronic commerce; Principal component analysis; Support vector machines; Websites; Cyber security; Detection methods; E- commerces; E-banking; High-accuracy; Machine-learning; On-machines; Phishing website detection; Phishing websites; Xgboost; Nearest neighbor search","","","","Badotra, Sumit, A systematic review on security of E-commerce systems, International Journal of Applied Science and Engineering, 18, 2, pp. 1-19, (2021); International Journal of Smart Sensor and Adhoc Network, (2022); Li, Jingwei, Significant Permission Identification for Machine-Learning-Based Android Malware Detection, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 14, 7, pp. 3216-3225, (2018); Bhuiyan, Md Zakirul Alam, Sensing and Decision Making in Cyber-Physical Systems: The Case of Structural Event Monitoring, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 12, 6, pp. 2103-2114, (2016); Bhardwaj, Akashdeep, Privacy-aware detection framework to mitigate new-age phishing attacks, Computers and Electrical Engineering, 96, (2021); undefined; Adewole, Kayode Sakariyah, Hybrid Rule-Based Model for Phishing URLs Detection, Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering, LNICST, 285, pp. 119-135, (2019); Babagoli, Mehdi, Heuristic nonlinear regression strategy for detecting phishing websites, Soft Computing, 23, 12, pp. 4315-4327, (2019); Jain, Ankit Kumar, A machine learning based approach for phishing detection using hyperlinks information, Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing, 10, 5, pp. 2015-2028, (2019); Sahingoz, Ozgur Koray, Machine learning based phishing detection from URLs, Expert Systems with Applications, 117, pp. 345-357, (2019)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","22142134; 22142126","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168805753"

We find that, following the official mandate of the Central Bank, inflation and inflation expectations as well as economic activity were significant topics in the adoption of policy measures between September 2004 and March 2016, with more emphasis on the former. Our indicators of forward guidance are not significant in the adoption of contemporary policy measures. Finally, with the help of latent semantic analysis, we extract the underlying factors that are then used in structural VAR models to identify and measure the impact of press releases’ shocks on inflation expectations.

Design/methodology/approach: Earning, spending, saving and borrowing data collected between May 2021 and February 2022 from 17,819 consumers living in the United States were used to examine the factors associated with distrust of banks. Using a conceptual framework borrowed from the health services profession, the study was conducted in two stages. At the first stage, distrust among the unbanked and banked was estimated using a Boruta-random forest algorithm. At the second stage of the analysis, a logit regression model was estimated to validate the variables identified in the Boruta-random forest analysis. Findings: Results from the analyses show that distrust of banks is multi-layered where being older, believing the country is heading in the wrong direction and being less confident in one's ability to obtain a personal loan in the amount of $1 to $999 are important factors related to distrust of banks among the unbanked. Research limitations/implications: This study shows how an ensemble machine learning technique based on a decision-tree methodology can be used to obtain unique insights into complicated data and large datasets within the bank marketing field.

Findings: The results reveal that consumers' responses to AI (vs human) credit decisions depend on the type of credit product. For personal loans, the rejection by an AI provider triggers higher levels of satisfaction compared to a credit analyst. This effect is explained via the perceived role congruity. In addition, the findings reveal that consumers’ rejection sensitivity determines how they perceive financial services role congruity.

However, the increasing number of credit card users has led to a rise in credit card default rates, posing challenges for banks. To address this issue and effectively control credit risk, leveraging data analytics becomes crucial. This study aims to predict loan defaults, enabling banks to proactively mitigate potential losses by offering alternative options to borrowers. To achieve this objective, we propose a system that utilizes various machine learning classification algorithms. Specifically, we explore and compare the performance of Logistic Regression, XGBoost, k-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Network, and Random Forest models in predicting credit risk.

These phenomena can be transmitted like a domino effect, and they are referred to as the contagion effect in the scientific literature. In this research, one of the four forms of financial contagion, known as residual contagion, is studied on the mortgage loan market in Romania using agent-based modeling. By considering the economic crisis of 2007–2009, also supported by the mortgage crisis, in the present paper, we aim to study the Romanian mortgage market in 2022 through the use of machine learning techniques and agent-based modeling. The purpose of this research is to capture the potential systemic risks that can outline a residual financial contagion effect. The simulation results highlight the fact that the degree of connectivity between the commercial banks in Romania and the way in which they are interconnected have a major importance in the emergence and propagation of contagion effects. The proposed approach and the obtained results can offer more insight to policymakers on how the contagion effect takes place within the banking sector. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Financial Contagion; Machine Learning; Mortgage Market; Netlogo; Artificial Intelligence; Banking; Global Economy; Machine Learning; Market System; Mortgage Lending; Research Work; Simulation; Romania","artificial intelligence; banking; global economy; machine learning; market system; mortgage lending; research work; simulation; Romania","","","The degree of uncertainty on macroeconomic developments, both at the national and global levels, has increased substantially in the recent period of time [].

This rapid progress in AI has brought increasing attention to the potential impacts of AI technologies on society, with ethically questionable consequences. In recent years, several ethical principles have been released by governments, national organizations, and international organizations. These principles outline high-level precepts to guide the ethical development, deployment, and governance of AI. However, the abstract nature, diversity, and context-dependence of these principles make them difficult to implement and operationalize, resulting in gaps between principles and their execution. Most recent work analyzed and summarized existing AI principles and guidelines but did not provide findings on principle-to-practice gaps nor how to mitigate them. These findings are particularly important to ensure that AI practical guidances are aligned with ethical principles and values. In this article, we provide a contextual and global evaluation of current ethical AI principles for all continents, with the aim to identify potential principle characteristics tailored to specific countries or applicable across countries. Next, we analyze the current level of AI readiness and current practical guidances of ethical AI principles in different countries, to identify gaps in the practical guidance of AI principles and their causes. Finally, we propose recommendations to mitigate the principle-to-practice gaps. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence (ai); Ethical Principles; Ethics; Ethicsops; Gap Analysis; Principle Practical Guidance; Artificial Intelligence; Ethical Technology; 'current; Banking And Finance; Daily Lives; Ethical Principles; Ethicsop; Gap Analysis; Potential Impacts; Practical Guidance; Principle Practical Guidance; Space Explorations; Space Research","Artificial intelligence; Ethical technology; 'current; Banking and finance; Daily lives; Ethical principles; Ethicsop; Gap analysis; Potential impacts; Practical guidance; Principle practical guidance; Space explorations; Space research","","","","Kourou, Konstantina D., Machine learning applications in cancer prognosis and prediction, Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal, 13, pp. 8-17, (2015); Kuutti, Sampo, A Survey of Deep Learning Applications to Autonomous Vehicle Control, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 22, 2, pp. 712-733, (2021); Gui, Guan, Flight delay prediction based on aviation big data and machine learning, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 69, 1, pp. 140-150, (2020); Tech Rep, (2023); Floridi, Luciano, AI4People—An Ethical Framework for a Good AI Society: Opportunities, Risks, Principles, and Recommendations, Minds and Machines, 28, 4, pp. 689-707, (2018); Nature Machine Intelligence, (2019); Hagendorff, Thilo, The Ethics of AI Ethics: An Evaluation of Guidelines, Minds and Machines, 30, 1, pp. 99-120, (2020); Principled Artificial Intelligence Mapping Consensus in Ethical and Rights Based Approaches to Principles for AI, (2020); Schiff, Daniel S., Explaining the Principles to Practices Gap in AI, IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, 40, 2, pp. 81-94, (2021); Ethics by Design and Ethics of Use Approaches for Artificial Intelligence, (2021)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","26914581","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144060132"

In this study, we establish a new benchmark using consumer data and present machine learning methods. A risk prediction that is as accurate as possible is an important requirements for credit scoring models. In addition, regulators expect that the models should to be auditable and transparent. As a result, the superior predictive power of contemporary machine learning algorithms cannot be fully utilized in credit scoring because very simple predictive models, such as several ML classifiers, are still widely used. As a result, significant potential is missed, increasing reserves or the number of credit defaults. A framework for comparing scores before and after feature selection machine learning models that are transparent, auditable, and explainable is presented in this article, as well as the various dimensions that need to be taken into consideration in order to make credit scoring models understandable. In accordance with this framework, we give an overview of the models which demonstrate how it can be used in credit scoring, and compare the results to scorecards' interpretability. The model presented demonstrates that machine learning techniques can maintain their ability to enhance predictive power while still maintaining a comparable level of interpretability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank Credit; Ensemble; Feature Selection; Machine Learning; Roc (auc) Curve; Stacking; Voting","","","","","Munkhdalai, Lkhagvadorj, An empirical comparison of machine-learning methods on bank client credit assessments, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 3, (2019); Kuwait Journal of Machine Learning; van Thiel, Diederick, Artificial intelligence credit risk prediction: An empirical study of analytical artificial intelligence tools for credit risk prediction in a digital era, Journal of Risk Management in Financial Institutions, 12, 3, pp. 268-286, (2019); Ubarhande, Prashant, Elements of Credit Rating: A Hybrid Review and Future Research Agenda, Cogent Business and Management, 8, 1, (2021); Saidi, Rania, Hybrid feature selection method based on the genetic algorithm and pearson correlation coefficient, Studies in Computational Intelligence, 801, pp. 3-24, (2019); Kabir, Md Monirul, A new hybrid ant colony optimization algorithm for feature selection, Expert Systems with Applications, 39, 3, pp. 3747-3763, (2012); International Journal of New Practices in Management and Engineering, (2014); Chaurasia, Vikas, Detection of Parkinson's Disease by Using Machine Learning Stacking and Ensemble Method, Biomedical Materials and Devices, 1, 2, pp. 966-978, (2023); Soria, Daniele, A 'non-parametric' version of the naive Bayes classifier, Knowledge-Based Systems, 24, 6, pp. 775-784, (2011); Park, Hyeounae, An introduction to logistic regression: From basic concepts to interpretation with particular attention to nursing domain, Journal of Korean Academy of Nursing, 43, 2, pp. 154-164, (2013)","","Auricle Global Society of Education and Research","","","","","","23218169","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167364103"

Even though AI provides great advantage in application changes it is essential to remodel the system using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) design system. Also the standard sensing models provides appropriate monitoring values but huge size of sensors is considered as a major drawback. Thus two diverse problems are addressed in this research work where XAI has been integrated with micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) for solving the problems related to BFS applications. Further the data security has been enhanced as XAI is implemented with conviction managements and real time experiments are carried out by developing a unique application by integrating new mathematical designs. To validate the effectiveness of BFS application the developed model is tested with five scenarios which includes multiple parametric arrangements with interpretability process. The tested and compared outcomes with existing models indicates that XAI and MEMS provides inordinate improvements in terms of data impairments thus increasing the transparency of the projected system to an average 96%. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking And Finance Sector; Data Impairments; Decision Making; Explainable Artificial Intelligence (xai); Micro Electro-mechanical Systems (mems); Article; Artificial Intelligence; Decision Making; Finance; Information Security; Problem Solving","article; artificial intelligence; decision making; finance; information security; problem solving","","","","Confalonieri, Roberto, A historical perspective of explainable Artificial Intelligence, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 11, 1, (2021); Meske, Christian, Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Objectives, Stakeholders, and Future Research Opportunities, Information Systems Management, 39, 1, pp. 53-63, (2022); Complexity, (2021); Mohseni, Sina, A Multidisciplinary Survey and Framework for Design and Evaluation of Explainable AI Systems, ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 11, 3-4, (2021); Khan, Muhammad Shahbaz, MEMS Sensors for Diagnostics and Treatment in the Fight against COVID-19 and Other Pandemics, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 61123-61149, (2021); Explainable Transparent Autonomous Agents and Multi Agent Systems, (2020); Łuczak, Sergiusz, Novel algorithm for tilt measurements using MEMS accelerometers, MATEC Web of Conferences, 157, (2018); Antoniadi, Anna Markella, Current challenges and future opportunities for xai in machine learning-based clinical decision support systems: A systematic review, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 11, 11, (2021); Explainable Artificial Intelligence Xai an Engineering Perspective, (2021); Sridevi, T., Wireless sensor data mining for e-commerce applications, Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, 14, 1, pp. 462-470, (2019)","","SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","20477163; 00368504","","","37533330","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166416779"

This paper aims to examine how the adoption of Islamic banking to various degrees affects economics outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses machine-learning tools to build a happiness function and integrate it in an agent-based model to test for the direct and indirect welfare effects of implementing Islamic banking principles. Findings: This study shows that even though Islamic banking systems tend to reduce economic activity, financial stability and societal happiness is improved. Additionally, a banking sector using Islamic principles across all its members is better equipped to handle banking crises because contagion to both economic activity and societal welfare is greatly reduced. At the same time, adoption of the profit-and-loss sharing (PLS) paradigm by banks may also slow down economic growth. Research limitations/implications: The findings extend existing literature on the advantages of Islamic banking, by quantifying the welfare benefits of the PLS paradigm on happiness and financial stability.

Conventional selection processes often struggle to identify the most suitable candidates from a pool of loan applicants. In response to this challenge, we present an innovative machine learning (ML) based loan prediction system designed to identify qualified loan applicants autonomously. This comprehensive study encompasses data preprocessing, effective data balancing using SMOTE, and the implementation of diverse ML models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and advanced deep learning models such as deep neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and long short-term memory models. The model's performance is rigorously assessed in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1_score. Our experimental analysis reveals that the Extra Trees outperforms its counterparts. Furthermore, we successfully predict bank loan defaulters through an ensemble voting model, which includes the top three ML models, achieving a remarkable 0.62% increase in accuracy compared to the Extra Trees.

In recent years, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, bank fraud has become even more common due to the massive transition of many operations to online platforms and the creation of many charitable funds that criminals can use to deceive users. The present work focuses on machine learning algorithms as a tool well suited for analyzing and recognizing online banking transactions. The study’s scientific novelty is the development of machine learning models for identifying fraudulent banking transactions and techniques for preprocessing bank data for further comparison and selection of the best results. This paper also details various methods for improving detection accuracy, i.e., handling highly imbalanced datasets, feature transformation, and feature engineering. The proposed model, which is based on an artificial neural network, effectively improves the accuracy of fraudulent transaction detection. The results of the different algorithms are visualized, and the logistic regression algorithm performs the best, with an output AUC value of approximately 0.946. The stacked generalization shows a better AUC of 0.954.

Despite the evidence of no universal best model, the results indicate that ML methods can, in numerous cases, outperform traditional econometric models in terms of mean-squared error. Moreover, the results indicate the existence of nonlinearities in the inflation dynamics, which are relevant to forecasting inflation.

Then, a set of prediction models will be used to project the risk rating of these institutions. Conventionally, the literature analyzes bank insolvency risk from accounting data and macroeconomic variables. In addition to these variables, this paper will construct a series of bank institution manager sentiment, via quarterly reports (ITR), and this will be used to improve the accuracy of bank risk predictions. The results indicate that the bank risk classification, via the k-means algorithm, was able to classify 17% of the sample into the highest risk group (1), while 83% of the sample was in the lowest bankruptcy risk group (0). Using the Z-score metric, we found that 65% of the sample is in the low-risk group, and 35% of the sample is in the high-risk group. Thus, the k-means algorithm is more rigorous in classifying a bank in the highest risk category. Next we used the data already described to project the risk of bank insolvency. The results of this step showed that the decision tree model performed the best for the test sample. In addition, it was found that the inclusion of the bank sentiment variable was able to improve the performance of the prediction models, especially, when bank sentiment is constructed from a time-varying dictionary. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank Insolvency; Banking Sentiment; Cluster; Learning","","","","","Early Warning System Para Distress Bancario no Brasil, (2017); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Chou, Chihhsun, Hybrid genetic algorithm and fuzzy clustering for bankruptcy prediction, Applied Soft Computing, 56, pp. 298-316, (2017); Environ Earth Sci, (2018); Climent, Francisco J., Anticipating bank distress in the Eurozone: An Extreme Gradient Boosting approach, Journal of Business Research, 101, pp. 885-896, (2019); Cole, Rebel A., Predicting Bank Failures: A Comparison of On- and Off-Site Monitoring Systems, Journal of Financial Services Research, 13, 2, pp. 103-117, (1998); Constantin, Andreea, Network linkages to predict bank distress, Journal of Financial Stability, 35, pp. 226-241, (2018); Curry, Timothy Jon, Equity market data, bank failures and market efficiency, Journal of Economics and Business, 59, 6, pp. 536-559, (2007); Risco De Insolvencia E Sentimento Textual Bancario Uma Analise Dos Bancos De Capital Aberto no Brasil, (2021); Eygi Erdogan, Bi̇rsen, Prediction of bankruptcy using support vector machines: An application to bank bankruptcy, Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation, 83, 8, pp. 1543-1555, (2013)","","Academic Press","","","","","","10909443","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151744675"

We build upon prior studies that suggest artificial intelligence algorithms are an effective approach to obtaining this understanding. Our approach uses behavioral finance and a unique decision-making model. Although the decision-making literature is replete with descriptions and explanations of creditors and investors' perceptions and judgment, it does not provide an algorithmic model that incorporates a more flexible approach to how creditors subjectively valuate risky projects. Specifically, a model is presented where 33 corporate bankers realized ex ante that they were unable to accurately model the underlying uncertainty that characterizes a company's need for a loan. The results indicate that bankers' risk assessments result in different evaluations of financial information regarding loans. This approach depicts an integrative algorithmic modelling process, whereby limits in the amount of historical conditional information prohibit the use of more complex econometric techniques. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Banking; Decision-making; Risk Aversion; Throughput Modelling; Artificial Intelligence; Investments; Risk Assessment; Risk Management; Algorithmic Model; Algorithmics; Artificial Intelligence Algorithms; Decision-based; Decisions Makings; Investment Decisions; New Approaches; Risk Aversion; Risk-taking Behaviors; Throughput Models; Decision Making; Algorithm; Artificial Intelligence; Banking; Credit Provision; Decision Making; Investment; Numerical Model","Artificial intelligence; Investments; Risk assessment; Risk management; Algorithmic model; Algorithmics; Artificial intelligence algorithms; Decision-based; Decisions makings; Investment decisions; New approaches; Risk aversion; Risk-taking behaviors; Throughput models; Decision making; algorithm; artificial intelligence; banking; credit provision; decision making; investment; numerical model","","","Funding text 1: Waymond Rodgers is a C.P.A.

This degrades the reputation of banks; hence, it is important to determine the difficulties that customers face. In business, churn prediction is helpful in determining metrics such as customer retention and revenue generation for various forms of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) techniques to forecast whether a customer will exit the bank. This study aims to develop a Profit-driven Churn Prediction (PCP) model using three Machine Learning (ML) techniques: an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a Random Forest Algorithm (RFA). The PCP model is developed using a correlation-based feature selection and a highly accurate ML classifier. This prediction model is trained using previous data to categorize consumers as non-churners or future churners. Customers’ behavioral and demographic features are considered reliable indicators of churn prediction. The developed PCP model is tested using a bank customer churn prediction dataset obtained from the Kaggle repository. The RFA, SVM, and ANN algorithms achieved overall accuracies of 86%, 82.3%, and 97%, respectively, for the churn dataset. The classification accuracy serves as the basis for the performance of the ML classifier. Hence, the ANN classifier is more accurate than the other classifiers in this study; they have been employed in PCP for churn prediction. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Neural Network; Customer Churn; Machine Learning; Random Forest Algorithm; Support Vector Machine","","","","","Shirazi, Farid, A big data analytics model for customer churn prediction in the retiree segment, International Journal of Information Management, 48, pp. 238-253, (2019); Neslin, Scott A., Defection detection: Measuring and understanding the predictive accuracy of customer churn models, Journal of Marketing Research, 43, 2, pp. 204-211, (2006); Muneer, Amgad, Predicting customers churning in banking industry: A machine learning approach, Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, 26, 1, pp. 539-549, (2022); Amin, Adnan, Customer churn prediction in telecommunication industry using data certainty, Journal of Business Research, 94, pp. 290-301, (2019); Ljubičić, Karmela, Churn prediction methods based on mutual customer interdependence, Journal of Computational Science, 67, (2023); Dias, Joana Matos, Machine learning for customer churn prediction in retail banking, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 12251 LNCS, pp. 576-589, (2020); Dalmia, Hemlata, Churning of Bank Customers Using Supervised Learning, Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, 107, pp. 681-691, (2020); Gholamiangonabadi, Davoud, Customer churn prediction using a meta-classifier approach; A case study of Iranian banking industry, 2019, MAR, pp. 364-375, (2019); Dahiya, Neelam, A Review paper on Machine Learning Applications, Advantages and Techniques, ECS Transactions, 107, 1, pp. 6137-6150, (2022); Singh, Gurpreet, CNN-RNN based Hybrid Machine Learning Model to Predict the Currency Exchange Rate: USD to INR, pp. 1668-1672, (2022)","","Totem Publishers Ltd","","","","","","29938341; 09731318","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164320820"

This last result is in line with the one obtained using machine learning techniques predicting the behavior of the new trend in the next 365 days. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking Revolution; Fintech; Fractional Integration; Machine Learning; Mean Reversion; Persistence","","","","Prof. Dr. Manuel Monge acknowledges support from an Internal Project of the Universidad Francisco de Vitoria.","Akaike, Hirotsugu, Maximum likelihood identification of gaussian autoregressive moving average models, Biometrika, 60, 2, pp. 255-265, (1973); Akaike, Hirotsugu, A Bayesian extension of the minimum aic procedure of autoregressive model fitting, Biometrika, 66, 2, pp. 237-242, (1979); Georgetown Journal of International Law, (2015); Bacq, Sophie, The COVID-19 Virtual Idea Blitz: Marshaling social entrepreneurship to rapidly respond to urgent grand challenges, Business Horizons, 63, 6, pp. 705-723, (2020); Dickey, David A., Distribution of the Estimators for Autoregressive Time Series With a Unit Root, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 74, 366, pp. 427-431, (1979); Diebold, Francis X., On the power of Dickey-Fuller tests against fractional alternatives, Economics Letters, 35, 2, pp. 155-160, (1991); Elliott, Graham, Efficient tests for an autoregressive unit root, Econometrica, 64, 4, pp. 813-836, (1996); Fintech and the Digital Transformation of Financial Services Implications for Market Structure and Public Policy, (2021); Introduction to Statistical Time Series, (1976); Gennaioli, Nicola, Money doctors, Journal of Finance, 70, 1, pp. 91-114, (2015)","","AfricaGrowth Institute","","","","","","18799337","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163311362"

The findings reveal that both push effects—namely, low empathy and low adaptability—and pull effects, including anytime/anywhere connectivity, association, visibility, and personalization, have positive influences on switching behavior.

This generation is tech savvy and the access to technology and network creates a conducive environment for such usage. Internet banking for the same reasons is growing leaps and bounds. The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) has created disruptions in the traditional banking also. This paper aims to analyze the comfort level and usage of AI-enabled banking services by Generation Z. Design/methodology/approach: The data is collected from 272 Generation Z members. The differential aspects, that is, the relationship of independent variables with dependent variables (AI-enabled internet banking), were analyzed using the structural equation modeling approach. Findings: Defining factors for AI-enabled internet banking were identified. The results of factors were consistent with previous studies. It was found that the usage of AI-enabled internet banking services is insignificant, indicating that Generation Z does not perceive any advantage in using AI-enabled internet banking services. Research limitations/implications: This paper does not incorporate age groups other than Generation Z. Further research could throw light on the difference based on age groups. Further research is required to deeply understand why Generation Z does not perceive AI-enabled internet services as very important. Practical implications: It has been observed that internet banking is important for Generation Z, but they also place greater importance on interpersonal communication. Banks need to consider this in designing their internet banking services. Originality/value: This paper addresses the gap between comfort with and usage of AI-enabled internet banking services, by Generation Z. This paper indicates that the comfort with AI-enabled internet banking services does not translate to usage. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai; Ai-enabled Internet Banking; Financial Services; Generation Z; Service Marketing","","","","","Afshan, Sahar, Internet banking in Pakistan: An extended technology acceptance perspective, International Journal of Business Information Systems, 27, 3, pp. 383-410, (2018); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); International Journal of Business and Management, (2016); Journal of Marketing Research, (1982); Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, (2013); Journal of Marketing Research, (1977); Journal of Consumer Research, (1994); Journal of Customer Behaviour, (2014); Bentler, Peter M., Comparative fit indexes in structural models, Psychological Bulletin, 107, 2, pp. 238-246, (1990); Testing Structural Equation Models, (1993)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","14636689; 14659832","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136706049"

However, it must be transformed to respond to emerging demands in society for better financial products and services with a positive impact on living conditions and well-being. To achieve this, banks must create economic value—that is to say, banks should create profits in a sustained manner—in order to also create social value and thus generate shared value. The purpose of this study was twofold. The first aim was to identify the main factors that contributed to the majority of Mexican banking profits in the period from 2003 to 2021; the second aim of the study was to provide an innovative metric of banking performance. Using supervised machine learning algorithms and Principal Component Analysis, two prediction models were tested, and two banking performance indices were defined. The findings show that Random Forest is a reliable profit prediction model with a lower mean absolute error between the predicted yearly profit and losses and the actual data. There are no significant ranking position differences between the two performance indices. The first performance index obtained is novel due to its simplicity, since it is built on the basis of five values associated with commercial banking activity. In Mexico, no similar studies have been published. The indicator most widely used by regulators worldwide is the CAMELS index, which is a weighted average of the capital adequacy level, asset quality, management capacity, profitability, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk. Its scale of 1 to 5 is useful for identifying the robustness and solvency of a bank, but not necessarily its capacity to generate profits. This approach might encourage banks to remain aware of their potential to create shared value and to develop competitive strategies to increase benefits for stakeholders. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking Sector; Economic Value; Innovation; Principal Component Analysis; Shared Value Creation; Social Value; Banking; Innovation; Machine Learning; Principal Component Analysis; Profitability; Mexico","banking; innovation; machine learning; principal component analysis; profitability; Mexico","","","","Porter, Michael E., Strategy & society: The link between competitive advantage and corporate social responsibility, Harvard Business Review, 84, 12, pp. 78-92, (2006); Porter, Michael E., Creating shared value, Harvard Business Review, 89, 1-2, (2011); Asian Journal of Sustainability and Social Responsibility, (2019); A Theory of Economic History, (1969); Festré, Agnès, Schumpeter on money, banking and finance: An institutionalist perspective, European Journal of the History of Economic Thought, 16, 2, pp. 325-356, (2009); Paulet, Elisabeth, Conventional banks and Fintechs: how digitization has transformed both models, Journal of Business Strategy, 41, 6, pp. 19-29, (2020); Salmony, Michael, Banks taking back control, Journal of Payments Strategy and Systems, 13, 1, pp. 13-19, (2019); Corner, Patricia Doyle, Shared Value Through Inner Knowledge Creation, Journal of Business Ethics, 135, 3, pp. 543-555, (2016); Veritas Sci, (2022); Caselli, Mauro, Access to Banking and the Role of Inequality and the Financial Crisis, B.E.

However, in recent years, advances in technology such as AI/ML have given rise to more models that predict more complicated facets of customer behavior, such as projected NPV. These can be used to precisely target profitable but risky customers. Using a unique regulatory panel dataset of credit cards combining data from many major banks, I construct both traditional risk and ML-based profit models and find that profit score cutoffs generally target wealthy, high-spending, “revolving” customers, while risk score cutoffs target low-activity “transacting” customers. Conducting simulations using both types of cutoffs, I find that, absent risk guardrails, profit-based underwriting could potentially cause an increase in riskiness in card portfolios. However, this is highly portfolio dependent and may only occur in those that concentrate on “revolvers” in the lower end of the credit spectrum. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consumer Finance; Credit Cards; Credit Risk; Machine Learning; Profit Models","","","","I would like to acknowledge Irina Barakova, Min Qi, Xinlei Zhao, Feng Li, Souphala Chomsisengphet, Luke Olson, and the anonymous reviewers for their invaluable suggestions and comments, and Qun Wang for her research assistance.","Agarwal, Sumit, Regulating consumer financial products: Evidence from credit cards, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 130, 1, pp. 111-164, (2015); undefined, (2019); Agarwal, Sumit, Do banks pass through credit expansions to consumers who want to borrow?, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 133, 1, pp. 129-190, (2018); American Economic Review, (1991); Aydin, Deniz, Consumption Response to Credit Expansions: Evidence from Experimental Assignment of 45,307 Credit Lines, American Economic Review, 112, 1, pp. 1-40, (2022); Butaru, Florentin, Risk and risk management in the credit card industry, Journal of Banking and Finance, 72, pp. 218-239, (2016); Xgboost Extreme Gradient Boosting, (2015); Einav, Liran, The impact of credit scoring on consumer lending, RAND Journal of Economics, 44, 2, pp. 249-274, (2013); Finlay, Steven M., Credit scoring for profitability objectives, European Journal of Operational Research, 202, 2, pp. 528-537, (2010); Elul, Ronel, What ""triggers"" mortgage default?, American Economic Review, 100, 2, pp. 490-494, (2010)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","03784266","","JBFID","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147003212"

The authors attempted to identify and classify cyber frauds and its drivers and correlate them for optimal mitigation planning. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology opted for the identification and classification is through a detailed literature review and focus group discussion with risk and vigilance officers and cyber cell experts. The authors assessed the future of cyber fraud in the Indian banking business through the machine learning–based k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) approach and prioritized and predicted the future of cyber fraud. The predicted future revealing dominance of a few specific cyber frauds will help to get an appropriate fraud prevention model, using an associated parties centric (victim and offender) root-cause approach. The study uses correlation analysis and maps frauds with their respective drivers to determine the resource specific effective mitigation plan. Findings: Finally, the paper concludes with a conceptual framework for preventing internal-led cyber fraud within the scope of the study. A cyber fraud mitigation ecosystem will be helpful for policymakers and fraud investigation officers to create a more robust environment for banks through timely and quick detection of cyber frauds and prevention of them. Research limitations/implications: Additionally, the study supports the Reserve Bank of India and the Government of India's launched cyber security initiates and schemes which ensure protection for the banking ecosystem i.e. RBI direct scheme, integrated ombudsman scheme, cyber swachhta kendra (botnet cleaning and malware analysis centre), National Cyber Coordination Centre (NCCC) and Security Monitoring Centre (SMC). Practical implications: Structured and effective internal-led plans for cyber fraud mitigation proposed in this study will conserve banks, employees, regulatory authorities, customers and economic resources, save bank authorities’ and policymakers’ time and money, and conserve resources. Additionally, this will enhance the reputation of the Indian banking industry and extend its lifespan. Originality/value: The innovative insider-led cyber fraud mitigation approach quickly identifies cyber fraud, prioritizes it, identifies its prominent root causes, map frauds with respective root causes and then suggests strategies to ensure a cost-effective and time-saving bank ecosystem. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyber Frauds; Fraud Drivers; Fraud Severity Mapping; Fraudster-infrastructure-target Model; K-nearest Neighbour (k-nn); Prevention Framework; Crime; Cybersecurity; Machine Learning; Malware; Nearest Neighbor Search; Cybe Fraud; Fraud Driver; Fraud Severity Mapping; Fraudster-infrastructure-target Model; Fraudsters; K-near Neighbor; Nearest-neighbour; Prevention Framework; Root Cause; Target Model; Ecosystems","Crime; Cybersecurity; Machine learning; Malware; Nearest neighbor search; Cybe fraud; Fraud driver; Fraud severity mapping; Fraudster-infrastructure-target model; Fraudsters; K-near neighbor; Nearest-neighbour; Prevention framework; Root cause; Target model; Ecosystems","","","The authors acknowledge the editor and anonymous reviewers for their timely and valuable inputs for the refinement of the paper.

This study aims to compare the latent themes uncovered by the topic modeling approach with studies focused on both mobile banking (m-banking) adaptation and service quality features, suggest new aspects and examine the effect of latent topics on customer satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: This study analyzed 21,526 reviews posted by customers of private and state banks operating in Türkiye. An unsupervised machine learning method, Latent Dirichlet algorithm (LDA), was conducted to reveal topics, and the distribution of all reviews was visualized with the t-SNE algorithm. Random Forest, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and Naive Bayes algorithms were utilized to predict user satisfaction through the given score. Findings: In total, 11 topics were revealed by considering user reviews based on their experience. Among these topics, perceived usefulness and convenience and time-saving are much more important in the scoring given to m-banking apps. Furthermore, in more detail, seven topics have been identified related to technical and security problems related to m-banking apps.

FinTech service providers are embracing contactless technology, including the development and widespread adoption of innovative payment service. Among the many types of contactless payment services, facial recognition payment (FRP) has gained in popularity. To capitalize on this rising popularity, comprehending the mechanisms underlying continuous usage intention toward FRP is essential. Drawing from the stimulus–organism–response (S-O-R) model, this study investigates how FRP attributes facilitate continuous usage intention. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 321 Chinese FRP users completed an online survey. Partial least squares structural equation modeling analyzed the results of the survey. Findings: The results reveal that relative advantage and compatibility, user-interface attractiveness and perceived security (stimuli) promote performance expectancy, effort expectancy and positive emotion (organism), which in turn foster FRP continuous usage intention (response). Originality/value: This research presents an S-O-R model that incorporates several attributes from DOI theory, the UTAUT model and the AIDUA framework to elucidate the antecedents of consumers' continuous usage intention toward FRP. The findings corroborate the significance of the S-O-R mechanism in FRP, setting the groundwork for the acceptance and development of biometric authentication technologies in service contacts and banks. In addition, the study highlights opportunities and essential aspects for FinTech service developers and providers to consider in terms of their practical significance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contactless Payment Services; Continuous Usage Intention; Facial Recognition Payment; Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling; Post-covid-19 Era; Stimulus–organism–response Model","","","","This work was supported by the Humanity and Social Science Youth foundation of Ministry of Education of China Grant [grant number 22YJC630074], the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation Grant [2021A1515012259], Shantou University STU Scientific Research Initiation Grant [STF20010], and The Ministry of Science and Technology (the National Science and Technology Council, NSTC) under the grant MOST111-2410-H002-012-MY2.","Al-Okaily, Manaf, The Determinants of Digital Payment Systems’ Acceptance under Cultural Orientation Differences: The Case of Uncertainty Avoidance, Technology in Society, 63, (2020); Al-Saedi, Karrar, Developing a general extended UTAUT model for M-payment adoption, Technology in Society, 62, (2020); Al-Sharafi, Mohammed A., Evaluating the sustainable use of mobile payment contactless technologies within and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic using a hybrid SEM-ANN approach, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 40, 5, pp. 1071-1095, (2022); Amin, Hanudin, An integrative approach for understanding Islamic home financing adoption in Malaysia, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 31, 7, pp. 544-573, (2013); Ariffin, Shaizatulaqma Kamalul, Understanding the consumer’s intention to use the e-wallet services, Spanish Journal of Marketing - ESIC, 25, 3, pp. 446-461, (2021); Arvidsson, Niklas, Consumer attitudes on mobile payment services - results from a proof of concept test, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 32, 2, pp. 150-170, (2014); Balapour, Ali, Mobile application security: Role of perceived privacy as the predictor of security perceptions, International Journal of Information Management, 52, (2020); Belanche, Daniel, Artificial Intelligence in FinTech: understanding robo-advisors adoption among customers, Industrial Management and Data Systems, 119, 7, pp. 1411-1430, (2019); Belanche, Daniel, Customer’s Acceptance of Humanoid Robots in Services: The Moderating Role of Risk Aversion, Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies, 167, pp. 449-458, (2020); Bhandari, Upasna, Effects of interface design factors on affective responses and quality evaluations in mobile applications, Computers in Human Behavior, 72, pp. 525-534, (2017)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","02652323","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142243051"

The latter allows for modeling correlation that is not accounted for by observable predictor variables. We find that machine learning methods have higher prediction accuracy compared to linear models with the differences being larger for longer prediction horizons. The likely reason for this is the presence of stronger interaction effects for longer prediction horizons compared to short horizons. Among all methods, tree-boosting has the highest prediction accuracy. Further, the frailty component of the newly proposed “LaGaBoost frailty model” is overall large and exhibits strong variation over time. In contrast to prior research, we find that upper tail predictions of loan portfolio losses of frailty models are not consistently higher throughout time compared to models ignoring frailty correlation, but they show more temporal variation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bankruptcy Modeling; Mixed Effects Model; Non-linear Model; Or In Banking; Risk Analysis; Adaptive Boosting; Decision Trees; Forestry; Machine Learning; Risk Analysis; Risk Assessment; Bankruptcy Modeling; Corporates; Frailty Models; Loan Portfolio; Machine Learning Methods; Mixed Effects Models; Multi-period; Non-linear Modelling; Or In Banking; Prediction Accuracy; Forecasting","Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Forestry; Machine learning; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Bankruptcy modeling; Corporates; Frailty models; Loan portfolio; Machine learning methods; Mixed effects models; Multi-period; Non-linear modelling; OR in banking; Prediction accuracy; Forecasting","","","We thank three anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments which have helped to improve this article.

Zeus is one of the most widespread banking malware variants ever discovered. Since the Zeus source code was leaked, many other variants of Zeus have emerged, and tools such as anti-malware programs exist that can detect Zeus; however, these have limitations. Anti-malware programs need to be regularly updated to recognise Zeus, and the signatures or patterns can only be made available when the malware has been seen. This limits the capability of these anti-malware products because they are unable to detect unseen malware variants, and furthermore, malicious users are developing malware that seeks to evade signature-based anti-malware programs. In this paper, a methodology is proposed for detecting Zeus malware network traffic flows by using machine learning (ML) binary classification algorithms. This research explores and compares several ML algorithms to determine the algorithm best suited for this problem and then uses these algorithms to conduct further experiments to determine the minimum number of features that could be used for detecting the Zeus malware. This research also explores the suitability of these features when used to detect both older and newer versions of Zeus as well as when used to detect additional variants of the Zeus malware. This will help researchers understand which network flow features could be used for detecting Zeus and whether these features will work across multiple versions and variants of the Zeus malware. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Binary Classification Algorithms; Deep Learning; Feature Selection; Machine Learning; Zeus Banking Malware; Zeus Malware Variants","","","","","International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science, (2017); Cybercrime to Cost the World 10 5 Trillion Annually by 2025, (2020); undefined; Ijpam International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics Scopus, (2017); Etaher, Najla, From ZeuS to zitmo: Trends in banking malware, 1, pp. 1386-1391, (2015); Sarojini, Selvaraj, Botnet detection on the analysis of zeus panda financial botnet, International Journal of Engineering and Advanced Technology, 8, 6, pp. 1972-1976, (2019); Owen, Harry, A Survey on Botnets, Issues, Threats, Methods, Detection and Prevention, Journal of Cybersecurity and Privacy, 2, 1, pp. 74-88, (2022); Tayyab, Umm E.Hani, A Survey of the Recent Trends in Deep Learning Based Malware Detection, Journal of Cybersecurity and Privacy, 2, 4, pp. 800-829, (2022); Aboaoja, Faitouri A., Malware Detection Issues, Challenges, and Future Directions: A Survey, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 12, 17, (2022); Ahsan, Mostofa, Cybersecurity Threats and Their Mitigation Approaches Using Machine Learning—A Review, Journal of Cybersecurity and Privacy, 2, 3, pp. 527-555, (2022)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","2624800X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159234696"

It determines the set of features to be rejected, supposing their low contribution in discriminating the labels. The effectiveness of a classifier passes mainly through the set of selected features. In this paper, we identify the best features to learn from in the context of credit risk assessment in the financial industry. Financial institutions concur with the risk of approving the loan request of a customer who may default later, or rejecting the request of a customer who can abide by their debt without default. We propose a feature selection engineering approach to identify the main features to refer to in assessing the risk of a loan request. We use different feature selection methods including univariate feature selection (UFS), recursive feature elimination (RFE), feature importance using decision trees (FIDT), and the information value (IV). We implement two variants of the XGBoost classifier on the open data set provided by the Lending Club platform to evaluate and compare the performance of different feature selection methods. The research shows that the most relevant features are found by the four feature selection techniques. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classification; Credit Risk Assessment; Feature Selection Engineering; Machine Learning; Decision Trees; Feature Selection; Finance; Risk Assessment; Sales; Classification Features; Credit Risk Assessment; Data Attributes; Feature Selection Engineering; Feature Selection Methods; Features Selection; Learn+; Machine-learning; Retail Banking; Sets Of Features; Classification (of Information)","Decision trees; Feature Selection; Finance; Risk assessment; Sales; Classification features; Credit risk assessment; Data attributes; Feature selection engineering; Feature selection methods; Features selection; Learn+; Machine-learning; Retail banking; Sets of features; Classification (of information)","","","","Machine Learning in Business an Introduction to the World of Data Science, (2021); Machine Learning or Econometrics for Credit Scoring Let S Get the Best of both Worlds, (2025); Systems Engineering Procedia, (2012); Das, Sanjiv Ranjan, The future of fintech, Financial Management, 48, 4, pp. 981-1007, (2019); Tang, Jiliang, Feature selection for classification: A review, pp. 37-64, (2014); Kar, Moushmi, Univariate feature selection techniques for classification of epileptic eeg signals, Lecture Notes in Bioengineering, pp. 345-365, (2021); Guyon, Isabelle M., Gene selection for cancer classification using support vector machines, Machine Learning, 46, 1-3, pp. 389-422, (2002); Zien, Alexander, The feature importance ranking measure, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5782 LNAI, PART 2, pp. 694-709, (2009); Proceedings of the Mwsug 2013; undefined, (2021)","","MDPI","","","","","","20782489","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151097676"

High level of financial dollarization causes fragilities on the balance sheet of the banks. Due to the negative effects of dollarization on the banks, predicting the financial dollarization rate for the following periods becomes very crucial for the soundness of the banking sector. This study aims to predict the weekly movement of the financial dollarization rate in the Turkish banking sector. The dataset includes asset dollarization rate series for 848 weeks between 30/12/2005 and 25/03/2022. Four different machine learning algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine) are utilized to predict the next week's financial dollarization rate movement. The parameters of the machine learning algorithms are optimized with a genetic algorithm. The parameters are divided into two groups as common parameters and model-specific parameters. Common parameters are the parameters utilized in all machine learning models and include the score transform method, standardization choice, the values on the cost matrix (used to reduce the misclassification rate), and autoregressive degree. The overall dataset is divided into four sub-periods and three different predicting schemes are utilized in each sub-period and overall period. According to the results of the analysis, the prediction performance in the overall dataset, which covers a wider period, was up to 73 % and the prediction performance was up to 90 % in sub-period datasets where the economy was relatively stable. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Financial Dollarization; Financial Time Series Forecasting; Genetic Algorithm; Machine Learning Algorithms; Decision Trees; Developing Countries; Finance; Forecasting; Learning Algorithms; Nearest Neighbor Search; Support Vector Machines; Algorithm Learning; Balance Sheets; Banking Sectors; Financial Dollarization; Financial Time Series Forecasting; Machine Learning Algorithms; Naive Bayes; Nearest-neighbour; Prediction Performance; Turkishs; Genetic Algorithms","Decision trees; Developing countries; Finance; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Nearest neighbor search; Support vector machines; Algorithm learning; Balance sheets; Banking sectors; Financial dollarization; Financial time series forecasting; Machine learning algorithms; Naive bayes; Nearest-neighbour; Prediction performance; Turkishs; Genetic algorithms","","","The authors would like to thank to the editors and the anonymous reviewers for all of their careful, constructive and insightful comments and suggestions towards improving this study.","Ajide, Kazeem Bello, Dollarization and the “unbundling” of globalization in sub-Saharan Africa, Research in International Business and Finance, 47, pp. 398-409, (2019); Financial Dollarization, (2006); Marmara Universitesi Oneri Dergisi Cilt, (2022); Evolutionary Computation, (1993); Dollarization and Financial Development, (2018); Barra, Silvio, Deep learning and time series-To-image encoding for financial forecasting, IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica, 7, 3, pp. 683-692, (2020); Bartosik, Aleksandra, Evaluating safety and toxicity, pp. 119-137, (2021); Basso, Henrique S., Financial dollarization: The role of foreign-owned banks and interest rates, Journal of Banking and Finance, 35, 4, pp. 794-806, (2011); Bhatia, Parteek, Data Mining and Data Warehousing: Principles and Practical Techniques, pp. 1-477, (2019); Bocola, Luigi, Financial crises, dollarization, and lending of last resort in open economies, American Economic Review, 110, 8, pp. 2524-2557, (2020)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09574174","","ESAPE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142821902"

To access the decision-making process for granting or denying the loan, the outputs of these variables of sub-expert systems 1 and 2 are fed as inputs to the main expert system. To achieve banking business success factors (quality and time), the expert systems improve the quality of banking service provided. It is performed by reducing the number and size of financial and non-financial errors and their ability to detect error cases.

The present study aims to discuss the consumer’s perspective on artificial intelligence’s adoption in Asian countries. The questionnaire was developed and distributed to collect data from five Asian countries (Pakistan, China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Thailand). The total useable responses were 799. The results showed that the factors (awareness, attitude, subjective norms, perceived usefulness, and knowledge of artificial intelligence technology) had a significant and positive relationship with the intention to adopt AI in the banking sector. However, perceived risk shows a negative but significant relationship with the intentions to adopt AI.

This study introduces a dual formulation of network data envelopment analysis to evaluate the shadow price of non-performing loans, which could be regarded as a novel measure of potential financial risk. We further investigate the tradeoff between economic growth and financial risk from micro and macro perspectives. Our results show that the financial risk of city commercial banks and joint-stock banks is higher than that of the big four state-owned and policy banks. Our research proves that economic growth influences the risk levels of banks directly and indirectly. More specifically, our study confirms that economic growth can reduce the bank's risk by reducing the bank's loan capital ratio as an intermediary path, that an increase in the capital adequacy ratio has a positive effect on the bank's risk. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Economic Growth; Financial Risk; Machine Learning; Non-performing Loans; Shadow Price; Data Envelopment Analysis; Decision Making; Finance; Risk Assessment; Bank Performance; Banking Systems; Business Decisions; Business Management; Economic Growths; Financial Risks; Machine-learning; Non-performing Loan; Risk Measurement; Shadow Price; Machine Learning","Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Finance; Risk assessment; Bank performance; Banking systems; Business decisions; Business management; Economic growths; Financial risks; Machine-learning; Non-performing loan; Risk measurement; Shadow price; Machine learning","","","We acknowledge the research fund from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (72104028) and the financial support from the Beijing Institute of Technology Research Fund Program for Young Scholars.","Abou-El-Sood, Heba S., Are regulatory capital adequacy ratios good indicators of bank failure?

The research has two main goals. First, providing a complete and organic analysis of the DARQ technologies framework currently missing in the literature. Because this research focuses on the financial sector, more attention is dedicated to DARQ technologies in this industry. Second, studying applications of one of the DARQ technologies, AI, in personalized banking, where it appears to have a great potential impact. Design/methodology/approach: The research analyses both the supply side, collecting secondary data from documentation, reports and research studies to study the major trends and results obtained by leading banks, and on the demand side, collecting primary data through a dedicated survey and elaborating opinions and preferences of potential customers. Using this information, a detailed go-to-market plan based on the framework elaborated by Bain and Co. in 2012 is developed, considering the hypothesis of a well-known universal bank, operating globally, with an established brand and access to modern AI technologies, which decides to invest in this field as a priority. Findings: In addition to giving a detailed overview of DARQ technologies from a technical and a business perspective, the results related to the hypothetical case of the study help to understand which would be the most suitable target for the launch phase, which value proposition should be offered and how to deliver it, but also how to evolve the project to attract more customers and strengthen the relationship with the existing ones. Nevertheless, this research could be a starting point for future studies and updates, considering related evolutions, investigating more representative demand samples or analyzing how the combination of more DARQ technologies could be applied to the financial sector. Research limitations/implications: Some limitations affect this work. First, the topics studied are evolving rapidly and partially dependent on other innovations under development; therefore, they may become obsolete and less significant in the next years. As regard the data collection, the supply-side analysis involves strategical information kept private by companies; therefore, the collected data probably miss some useful details. As concerns primary data, the sample could have been larger and more heterogeneous and biases and misinterpretations could have affected the answers. A compromise has been found between the time and resources available and the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the sample. Practical implications: This research could be a tool for financial companies interested in investing in AI for personalized banking, but it also provides useful insights about the whole DARQ framework, which could be interesting for all the financial and nonfinancial firms. Applying AI effectively and efficiently could offer great benefits, both economic and noneconomic, to financial firms but also to their customers, who could benefit from hyper-tailored services at a reasonable and affordable price, whereas in the past, they were reserved only for very important person clients. This win-win situation could lead the way to further investments and consequent innovations in the future. Social implications: Some issues still exist, mainly about data security and privacy, but also the social risk linked to the labor market due to the AI substitution for some tasks and the related shift in professionals required by employers, which could negatively affect the salary gap among workers with different levels of educations, tightening up existing inequality problems. An effort by public and private subjects will be required to make this transition inside the labor market smoother. Despite this, the research shows that AI applications in personalized m-banking could mutually benefit both the demand and the supply of the market. Originality/value: Apart from the organic overview offered on DARQ technologies and their related business applications, currently missing in the literature, which could be useful for a better comprehension of the topic and could also give interesting insights to firms, this research presents an original and concrete roadmap to follow for financial companies interested in delivering a personalized mobile banking service leveraging on AI. Every step presented in the output of this work is based on an in-depth analysis of past, and present actions carried out and result obtained by competitive firms on the market and on needs and preferences observed among potential customers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Darq Technologies; Mobile Banking; Personalized Banking","","","","","International Journal of Business Research and Development, (2013); Techvision Redefine Banking with Artificial Intelligence, (2017); Accenture Technology Vision, (2019); Global Financial Services Consumer Study, (2019); Understanding the DNA of Darq, (2019); Al-Jabri, Ibrahim M., Mobile banking adoption: Application of diffusion of innovation theory, Journal of Electronic Commerce Research, 13, 4, pp. 379-391, (2012); Asset Management Banking and Insurance, (2019); Baabdullah, Abdullah Mohammed A., Consumer use of mobile banking (M-Banking) in Saudi Arabia: Towards an integrated model, International Journal of Information Management, 44, pp. 38-52, (2019); Bahrammirzaee, Arash, A comparative survey of artificial intelligence applications in finance: Artificial neural networks, expert system and hybrid intelligent systems, Neural Computing and Applications, 19, 8, pp. 1165-1195, (2010); Barclays App Features, (2019)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","17554179; 17554187","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132643571"

In addition to identifying and classifying cyber fraud, the study maps them on a severity scale for optimal mitigation planning. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology used for identification and classification is an analysis of a detailed literature review, a focus group discussion with risk and vigilance officers and cyber cell experts, as well as secondary data of cyber fraud losses. Through machine learning-based random forest, the authors predicted the future of insider-led cyber frauds in the Indian banking business and prioritized and predicted the same. The projected future reveals the dominance of a few specific cyber frauds, which will make it easier to develop a fraud mitigation model based on a victim-centric approach. Findings: The paper concludes with a conceptual framework that can be used to ensure a sustainable cyber fraud mitigation ecosystem within the scope of the study. By using the findings of this research, policymakers and fraud investigators will be able to create a more robust environment for banks through timely detection of cyber fraud and prevent it appropriately before it happens. Research limitations/implications: The study focuses on fraud, risk and mitigation from a victim-centric perspective and does not address it from the fraudster’s perspective. Data availability was a challenge. Banks are recommended to compile data that can be used for analysis both by themselves and other policymakers. Practical implications: The structured, sustainable cyber fraud mitigation suggested in the study will provide an agile, quick, proactive, stakeholder-specific plan that helps to safeguard banks, employees, regulatory authorities, customers and the economy. It saves resources, cost and time for bank authorities and policymakers. The mitigation measures will also help improve the reputational status of the Indian banking business and prolong the banks’ sustenance.

By scrutinizing the interplay between these variables, the primary objective of this study is to propose a novel approach conducive to fostering trust and acceptance of AI-driven banking services. The research methodology employed in this study is grounded in quantitative techniques, wherein structured questionnaires were administered to both customers and employees within the banking sector of Saudi Arabia. A total of 150 questionnaires were gathered from employees, while 200 were obtained from customers. The collected data underwent rigorous analysis utilizing mediational techniques and moderation analysis through established statistical methodologies, thereby facilitating the examination and testing of hypotheses. The study's results corroborate that the degree of trust in AI serves as an intermediary factor in the relationships between AI implementation across various sectors (e.g., fraud detection, transaction monitoring) and the financial self-efficacy of individuals. Additionally, the mediation role of AI Bank Transparency in these associations was identified, suggesting that heightened levels of transparency in AI operations enhance trust in AI technology. These findings underscore the pivotal roles played by trust and transparency in influencing consumer perceptions and behaviours regarding AI-driven services in the banking domain. The originality of this research study resides in its investigation of the mediating influence of trust in AI technology and the moderating impacts of bank transparency within the framework of AI integration in the Saudi Arabian banking sector.

Today, financial institutions actively use digital technologies in their own activities to improve work efficiency. Artificial intelligence is a technology that banks and other credit institutions are gradually using in their own work. This determines the urgency of researching new possibilities of using artificial intelligence in credit activities, primarily of banking institutions. The article uses the methodology of economic research for research. In particular, methods of content analysis, observation, abstraction, analysis and synthesis. As a result, promising directions for the use of artificial intelligence technology in the credit activity of banking institutions were determined, which was implemented on the basis of the analysis of specific features of such activity, the specification of the essence of the specified technology and the identification of its basic characteristics. As a result, it was established that the technology of artificial intelligence has a significant potential for use in the provision of credit services by banking institutions to various types of clients. It was also found that these institutions are already actively using the capabilities of this technology, but to a limited extent, which is due to a number of institutional restrictions and the imperfection of the technology itself. However, current trends show that in the future such obstacles will gradually disappear and the use of artificial intelligence by banking institutions will only expand. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Banking Institution; Banking Risks; Banking System; Credit Activity; Financial Institution; Non-bank Credit Institutions","","","","","Artificial Intelligence AI Adoption Rate in Product Development Businesses Worldwide in 2022 and 2025, (2022); Chen, Bili, Applications of artificial intelligence technologies in credit scoring: A survey of literature, pp. 658-664, (2014); Science Tech, (2023); Dayyabu, Yusuf Yusuf, The application of artificial intelligence techniques in credit card fraud detection: A quantitative study, E3S Web of Conferences, 389, (2023); Dennis, Mayorga Lira Sergio, Credit Risk Analysis: Using Artificial Intelligence in a Web Application, International Journal of Engineering Trends and Technology, 71, 1, pp. 305-316, (2023); Dhaigude, Rahul, Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Credit Scores in Lending Process, (2022); Dong, Yanwen, Comparison of statistical and artificial intelligence methodologies in small-businesses' credit assessment based on daily transaction data, ICIC Express Letters, 5, 5, pp. 1725-1730, (2011); Dubyna, Maksym, Development of the credit market of Ukraine under macroeconomic instability, Public and Municipal Finance, 12, 1, pp. 33-47, (2023); Artificial Intelligence AI, (2025); Qureshi, Farah, (Dis)crediting claims of financial inclusion: The integration of artificial intelligence in consumer credit markets in the united states and kenya, Journal of International and Comparative Law, 8, 2, pp. 405-434, (2021)","","REF Press","","","","","","19238401; 19237529","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182923702"

However, detecting targets in clutter and unfavorable conditions is challenging with conventional signal processing approaches such as Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR). The harsh and complex environments in radar measurements make the target detection problem even more challenging when using traditional methods. Therefore, developing a reliable and robust RTD technique is crucial. This paper proposes an approach that incorporates Machine Learning (ML) with conventional methods to detect, separate, and classify real targets from noisy backgrounds in a real radar dataset by employing Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering to segment the Range Doppler Map (RDM) image into targets and background, then a feature extraction technique based on gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and classify the targets using a support vector machine (SVM). The approach is based on an augmented Doppler Filter Bank (DFB) with RDM images and has been tested on a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar mounted on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for detecting ground targets. A flight was conducted in a challenging environment to evaluate the proposed system's performance. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of classification accuracy. The proposed approach is also computationally efficient and can be easily implemented in real-time systems and has great potential in improving RTD performance in various applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Doppler Filter Bank; Fuzzy C-means Cluster; Moving Target Detector; Radar Signal Processing; Support Vector Machine","","","","","Long, Teng, Advanced technology of high-resolution radar: target detection, tracking, imaging, and recognition, Science China Information Sciences, 62, 4, (2019); Gini, Fulvio, Grand Challenges in Radar Signal Processing, Frontiers in Signal Processing, 1, (2021); Mason, Eric S., Deep learning for radar, pp. 1703-1708, (2017); Wang, Li, A Study on Radar Target Detection Based on Deep Neural Networks, IEEE Sensors Letters, 3, 3, (2019); A Comprehensive Survey of Machine Learning Applied to Radar Signal Processing, (2020); Iteckne, (2017); Qi, Quan, One efficient target detection based on neural network under homogeneous and non-homogeneous background, 2017-October, pp. 1503-1507, (2017); Khalid, Habib Ur Rehman, Convolutional long short-term memory networks for doppler-radar based target classification, (2019); Akhtar, Jabran, GO-CFAR trained neural network target detectors, (2019); Thornton, Charles E., Deep Reinforcement Learning Control for Radar Detection and Tracking in Congested Spectral Environments, IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking, 6, 4, pp. 1335-1349, (2020)","","Wydawnictwo SIGMA-NOT","","","","","","00332097; 24499544","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179813111"

The current knowledge of health profession students about AI programs has still not been assessed in Jordan and the West Bank of Palestine (WBP). Aim: This study aimed to assess students’ awareness and practice of AI programs in medicine and pharmacy in Jordan and the WBP. Methods: This study was in the form of an observational, cross-sectional survey. A questionnaire was electronically distributed among students of medicine and pharmacy at An-Najah National University (WBP), Al-Isra University (Jordan), and Al-Balqa Applied University (Jordan). The questionnaire consisted of three main categories: sociodemographic characteristics of the partici-pants, practice of AI programs, and perceptions of AI programs, including ChatGPT. Results: A total of 321 students responded to the distributed questionnaire, and 261 participants (81.3%) stated that they had heard about AI programs. In addition, 135 participants had used AI programs before (42.1%), while less than half the participants used them in their university studies (44.2%): for drug information (44.5%), homework (38.9%), and writing research articles (39.3%). There was significantly (48.3%, P<0.005) more conviction in the use of AI programs for writing research articles among pharmacy students from Palestine compared to Jordan. Lastly, there was significantly more (53.8%, P<0.05) AI program use among medicine students than pharmacy students. Conclusion: While most medicine and pharmacy students had heard about AI programs, only a small proportion of the participants had used them in their medical study. In addition, attitudes and practice related to AI programs in their education differs between medicine and pharmacy students and between WBP and Jordan. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Education; Jordan; Medical Students; West Bank Of Palestine","","","","The authors would like to extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at An-najah University, Al-Balqa Applied University, and Isra University for supporting this research.","De Angelis, Luigi, ChatGPT and the rise of large language models: the new AI-driven infodemic threat in public health, Frontiers in Public Health, 11, (2023); Ang, Tiing Leong, The rise of artificial intelligence: addressing the impact of large language models such as ChatGPT on scientific publications, Singapore Medical Journal, 64, 4, pp. 219-221, (2023); Mohammed, Mustapha, Psychometric Properties and Assessment of Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice Towards ChatGPT in Pharmacy Practice and Education: a Study Protocol, Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities, 11, 4, pp. 2284-2293, (2024); Jairoun, Ammar Abdulrahman, ChatGPT: Threat or boon to the future of pharmacy practice?, Research in Social and Administrative Pharmacy, 19, 7, pp. 975-976, (2023); Cureus, (2023); Cureus, (2023); Kheir, N., Pharmacy education and practice in 13 middle eastern countries, American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education, 72, 6, (2008); Wazaify, Mayyada M.B., Pharmacy education in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait, American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education, 70, 1, (2006); Jarrar, Yazun Bashir, Knowledge and attitudes of pharmacy students towards pharmacogenomics among universities in Jordan and west bank of Palestine, Pharmacogenomics and Personalized Medicine, 12, pp. 247-255, (2019); Dave, Tirth, ChatGPT in medicine: an overview of its applications, advantages, limitations, future prospects, and ethical considerations, Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence, 6, (2023)","","Dove Medical Press Ltd","","","","","","11797258","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179651864"

Specifically, it utilizes the Baidu Index and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The Baidu Index, akin to China's version of Google Trends, serves as a sentiment barometer, while LSTM networks excel in analyzing sequential data, making them apt for stock price forecasting. Our model integrates sentiment indices from Baidu with historical stock data of significant Chinese banks, aiming to unveil how digital sentiment influences stock price movements. The model's forecasting prowess is rigorously evaluated using metrics such as R-squared (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and confusion matrices, the latter being instrumental in assessing the model's capability in correctly predicting stock up or down movements. Our findings predominantly showcase superior prediction performance of the sentiment-based LSTM model compared to a standard LSTM model. However, effectiveness varies across different banks, indicating that sentiment integration enhances prediction capabilities, yet individual stock characteristics significantly contribute to the prediction accuracy. This inquiry not only underscores the importance of integrating public sentiment in financial forecasting models but also provides a pioneering framework for leveraging digital sentiment in financial markets. Through this endeavor, we offer a robust analytical tool for investors, policymakers, and financial institutions, aiding in better navigation through the intricate financial market dynamics, thereby potentially leading to more informed decision-making in the digital age. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking Sector; Forecasting; Lstm; Machine Learning; Sentiment; Commerce; Decision Making; Electronic Trading; Errors; Financial Markets; Investments; Long Short-term Memory; Mean Square Error; Banking Sectors; Google Trends; Machine Learning Techniques; Machine-learning; Memory Modeling; Memory Network; Neural-networks; Public Sentiments; Sentiment; Stock Predictions; Forecasting","Commerce; Decision making; Electronic trading; Errors; Financial markets; Investments; Long short-term memory; Mean square error; Banking sectors; Google trends; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Memory modeling; Memory network; Neural-networks; Public sentiments; Sentiment; Stock predictions; Forecasting","","","","Shiller, Robert J., Speculative asset prices, American Economic Review, 104, 6, pp. 1486-1517, (2014); Li, Xiaodong, Stock Prediction via Sentimental Transfer Learning, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 73110-73118, (2018); Lang, Qiaoqi, Is Baidu index really powerful to predict the Chinese stock market volatility?

Being the primary adopter of such innovations, banking has recently started using the most common AI-based technology, i.e., conversational agents. Although research extensively focuses on this niche area and provides bibliometric understanding for such agents in other industries, a similar review with scientometric insights of the banking literature concerning AI conversational agents is absent till date. Furthermore, in the era following the pandemic, banks are faced with the imperative to provide solutions that align with the changing landscape of remote consumer behavior. As a result, banks are proactively integrating technology-driven solutions, such as automated agents, to effectively address the growing demand for remote customer support. Hence more research is needed to perfect such agents. In order to bridge these existing gaps, the present study undertook a comprehensive examination of two decades’ worth of banking literature. A meticulous review was conducted, analyzing approximately 116 papers published from 2003 to 2023. The aim was to provide a scientometric overview of the topic, catering to the research needs of both academic and industrial professionals. Holistically, the study seeks to present a macro-view about the existing trends in AI based banking conversational agents’ literature while focusing on quantity, qualitative and structural indicators that are effectively necessary to offer new directions for the AI-based banking solutions.

The global financial crisis of 2008-2009, the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as various other episodes of high economic uncertainty since the turn of the millennium have adjusted central banks to a number of serious challenges and have led to the expansion of these mandates and emerging and exploiting new and extensive data. The study briefly notes on this as a big database (big data) and applications of AI/ML-based techniques that can provide support on monetary policy decisions, especially during times of uncertainty in the economy, referring to the latest research in this area. Also, concrete examples based on the creation of big data and AI/ML techniques applied in the activities of the European Central Bank and other central banks in Europe and the rest of the world are considered and analyzed. The analysis reveals that big data and AI/ML methods have demonstrated successful utility in conducting monetary policy by central banks. Although useful as a complement, these tools cannot be regarded as replacements for conventional data and methods due to issues related to statistics, the ability to interpret outcomes and ethical dilemmas. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Big Data; Central Banks; Economic Uncertainty; Machine Learning; Monetary Policy","","","","2 This scientific article is funded by scientific project with contract № KP-06-М45/4 in 2020/12.07.2021 entitled “Fiscal and Monetary Instruments for Regulating Uncertainty in the Economy” from the Competition for Financial Support for Project of Junior Basic Researchers and Postdocs – 2020 of The Bulgarian National Science Fund.

Through a systematic review of related literature, this study aims to investigate the drivers and barriers to adopting AI in the banking industry from the perspective of the major stakeholders: the bank, the customers, the service providers, and the regulators. Using the SCOPUS database, thirty-five studies were identified that are relevant to this study. Given that organizational innovation requires a cohesive strategy considering internal and external ecologies, this study contributes to the literature on AI adoption in the banking industry by providing a multi-stakeholder perspective. Existing literature focuses predominantly on the customers' and the banks' perspectives. Studies from the regulators' and service providers' perspectives still need to be more extensive despite the importance of these two actors in adopting AI in the banking industry. From the standpoint of the customer, reasons for adoption include security, trustworthiness, understanding, familiarity, and positive feedback from others. Meanwhile, trust issues, security issues, unreliability, unavailability, and technology downtime deter customers from adopting AI. From the bank's perspective, AI adoption is enabled by the availability of technological resources, human resources, infrastructure, financial resources, and documentation. On the other hand, lack of skills, lack of awareness, high cost, time-to-market, technical complexity, and regulatory-compliance issues deter banks from fully embracing AI. Transparency of algorithms, data privacy, data protection, and fair use of data are the main concerns both of regulators and customers. The results of this study contribute to the practice of AI in banking by pointing to the need for more empirical and theoretical research on the regulatory perspective of AI adoption in the banking industry to foster responsible AI, how to harness the strength of service providers to enable broader and more effective adoption of AI, how institutions can help increase the talent pool for AI-driven technologies, and how to strengthen the synergistic cooperation of the various stakeholders in the adoption of AI in the banking industry. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Bank; Finance; Innovation; Regulators; Service Providers; Technology Adoption","","","","","Abu Daqar, Mohannad A.M., Fintech in the eyes of Millennials and Generation Z (the financial behavior and Fintech perception), Banks and Bank Systems, 15, 3, pp. 20-28, (2020); Adams, Richard J., Shades of Grey: Guidelines for Working with the Grey Literature in Systematic Reviews for Management and Organizational Studies, International Journal of Management Reviews, 19, 4, pp. 432-454, (2017); Ali, Mohammad Sami, EVALUATING THE ROLE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE AUTOMATION OF THE BANKING SERVICES INDUSTRY: EVIDENCE FROM JORDAN, Humanities and Social Sciences Letters, 10, 3, pp. 383-393, (2022); Almaiah, Mohammed Amin, Measuring Institutions’ Adoption of Artificial Intelligence Applications in Online Learning Environments: Integrating the Innovation Diffusion Theory with Technology Adoption Rate, Electronics (Switzerland), 11, 20, (2022); Ashta, Arvind, Artificial intelligence and fintech: An overview of opportunities and risks for banking, investments, and microfinance, Strategic Change, 30, 3, pp. 211-222, (2021); Bhatia, Ankita, Robo advisory and its potential in addressing the behavioral biases of investors — A qualitative study in Indian context, Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance, 25, (2020); Belanche, Daniel, Artificial Intelligence in FinTech: understanding robo-advisors adoption among customers, Industrial Management and Data Systems, 119, 7, pp. 1411-1430, (2019); Economic Effects of Technological Progress Evidence from the Banking Industry, (2002); Boustani, Nada Mallah, Artificial intelligence impact on banks clients and employees in an Asian developing country, Journal of Asia Business Studies, 16, 2, pp. 267-278, (2022); Carminati, Michele, Security evaluation of a banking fraud analysis system, ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security, 21, 3, (2018)","","Universidade do Porto - Faculdade de Engenharia","","","","","","21830606","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178121258"

Most entrepreneurs are unwilling to take loans from banks because their loan applications are rejected for various reasons. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, an automated recommendation system has been provided in a mobile application. This paper collects a real-time dataset for loan approval prediction systems. The system also develops a prediction model using machine learning algorithms that predict an entrepreneur’s loan eligibility.

This study develops a predictive model using machine learning (ML) to categorise banks into low- or high-performance. The non-performing assets (NPA) levels of the Indian banking sector, notably for the public sector banks (PSBs), have increased significantly since 2015. Hence, the model has been created using bank performance data of PSBs, specifically for the period 2015–2020. The authors first identified logical groups by using the unsupervised K-means clustering method; and, subsequently, deployed a supervised algorithm for prediction: the classification and regression tree (CART).

They monitor online banking transaction histories and use their own methods to detect and prevent unauthorized electronic fund transfers. However, unauthorized electronic fund transfers by criminals have not been eliminated. The average rate of false positives in the transaction monitoring systems installed in Japanese banks is up to 99%, indicating that the monitoring systems are not fully functional. Furthermore, the personnel responsible for fraud detection must manually check a large number of false positives, making it difficult for operators to be productive in their assigned tasks. Based on the above background, we develop a method to detect unauthorized electronic fund transfers and suspicious transactions with high accuracy using machine learning algorithms and evaluate its accuracy. Specifically, a supervised machine learning algorithm is applied to detect fraudulent transactions automatically. We evaluated the proposed method on a large set of online banking transaction data provided by a major Japanese bank for the period March 2019 to May 2020.

However, as the number of transactions grow, the need for efficient load-balancing algorithms to ensure optimal utilization of cloud resources and improve system performance becomes critical. This paper proposes an ensemble cloud load-balancing (ECBA) algorithm specifically designed to process multiple banking transactions. The proposed algorithm combines the strengths of several load-balancing techniques to achieve a balanced distribution of transaction loads in various cloud servers. It considers factors such as transaction types, server capacities, and network conditions to make intelligent load distribution decisions. The algorithm dynamically adapts to changing workload patterns and optimizes resource allocation by leveraging machine learning and predictive analytics. A simulation environment that mimics the banking system's transaction processing workflow is created to evaluate the performance of the ensemble load balancing algorithm. Extensive experiments with various workload scenarios are conducted to assess the algorithm's effectiveness in load balancing, response time, resource utilization, and overall system performance. The results show that the proposed ECBA outperforms traditional banking load-balancing approaches. It reduces response time, improves resource utilization, and ensures every server is adequately funded with a few transactions. The algorithm's adaptability and scalability make it well-suited for handling dynamic and fluctuating workloads, thus providing a robust solution for processing multiple transactions in the banking sector. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking; Cloud Computing; Ensemble Algorithm; Load Balancing; Resource Utilization; Response Time; Scalability; Transaction Processing; Balancing; Cost Effectiveness; Machine Learning; Predictive Analytics; Response Time (computer Systems); Banking Industry; Cloud-computing; Ensemble Algorithms; Load-balancing; Load-balancing Algorithm; Multiple Transactions; Resources Utilizations; Response Time; Systems Performance; Transaction Processing; Scalability","Balancing; Cost effectiveness; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Response time (computer systems); Banking industry; Cloud-computing; Ensemble algorithms; Load-Balancing; Load-balancing algorithm; Multiple transactions; Resources utilizations; Response time; Systems performance; Transaction processing; Scalability","","","","Kumar, Pawan, Issues and challenges of load balancing techniques in cloud computing: A survey, ACM Computing Surveys, 51, 6, (2019); Annie Poornima Princess, G., A Hybrid Meta-Heuristic for Optimal Load Balancing in Cloud Computing, Journal of Grid Computing, 19, 2, (2021); Elmagzoub, M.

Viewing bank profitability from three different dimensions, Net Interest Margins (NIM), Return on Assets (RoA) and Return on Equity (RoE), this study has explored the key determinants with the help of machine learning algorithms. It has used a pooled data set of domestic and commercial banks covering 2005–2021. As a dependent variable, profitability by each measure (NIM, RoA and RoE) is reclassified into three categories, above average, average and below average, based on their quartiles. Twenty-one explanatory variables comprising bank-specific, macroeconomic and policy variables are chosen after due validation using feature selection methodology and multicollinearity check. The random forest (RF) classification algorithm is executed using the CARET package in R. The results obtained from feature selection are corroborated with the RF classification findings. The results are robust and give clear-cut visibility of unique and common factors influencing three profitability measures at varying levels. The classification estimates suggest that the bank-specific variables are major determinants of NIM, while macroeconomic and policy variables are the key determinants of RoA and RoE. Further, the results also suggest that the ratio of non-performing assets to total assets and business per employee are two such bank-specific determinants that play an important role in all three dimensions of profitability. Thus, recapitalization and automation will play an important role in bank profitability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Feature Selection; Nim; Random Forest; Roa; Roe","","","","","Almaqtari, Faozi A., The determinants of profitability of Indian commercial banks: A panel data approach, International Journal of Finance and Economics, 24, 1, pp. 168-185, (2019); Al-Homaidi, Eissa A., Bank-specific and macro-economic determinants of profitability of Indian commercial banks: A panel data approach, Cogent Economics and Finance, 6, 1, pp. 1-26, (2018); Athanasoglou, Panayiotis P., Bank-specific, industry-specific and macroeconomic determinants of bank profitability, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 18, 2, pp. 121-136, (2008); Bapat, Dhananjay Madhukar, Profitability drivers for Indian banks: a dynamic panel data analysis, Eurasian Business Review, 8, 4, pp. 437-451, (2018); Random Forests, (2001); Bank Asset Quality in Emerging Markets Determinants and Spillovers, (2012); Indian Banking Sector on the Road to Progress, (2016); An R Companion to Applied Regression, (2011); Garcia, Maria Teresa Medeiros, Internal and external determinants of banks’ profitability: The Portuguese case, Journal of Economic Studies, 43, 1, pp. 90-107, (2016); Gaur, Dolly, Non-performing Assets and Profitability: Case of Indian Banking Sector, Vision, 25, 2, pp. 180-191, (2021)","","Sage Publications India Pvt.

Banks can issue loans only to specific authentic people or organizations due to restricted resources or credits. Those who actually can able to repay the taken loan amount along with interest are safe people to whom loan can be sanctioned, but finding eligible (safe) people is a monotonous process. The problem is addressed by various researchers in the literature, however, accuracy level of their models proposed is utmost of 80%. Hence in our work, we proposed a model in which various machine learning algorithms are aggregated with ensemble algorithms like bagging and voting classifiers. The pre-eminent objective of our work is to predict whether a particular person is eligible for the loan or not. Our proposed model reduces human efforts and processing time as well and produces more accurate results than existing models. Experimental results show that our model improves the performance of the existing model from 80% to 94%. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bagging Classifier; Finance; Loan; Machine Learning; Voting Classifier","","","","","Bhat, S.

Financial institutions try to adapt to this trend and invent new ways and channels to reach and interact with their customers. While banks are opening their services to avoid missing this shift, they become naturally exposed to fraud attempts through their digital banking platforms. Therefore, fraud prevention and detection are considered must-have capabilities. Detecting fraud at an optimal time requires developing and deploying scalable learning systems capable of ingesting and analyzing vast volumes of streaming records. Current improvements in data analytics algorithms and the advent of open-source technologies for big data processing and storage bring up novel avenues for fraud identification. In this article, we provide a real-time architecture for detecting transactional fraud via behavioral analysis that incorporates big data analysis techniques such as Spark, Kafka, and h2o with an unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithm named Isolation Forest. The results of experiments on a significant dataset of digital transactions indicate that this architecture is robust, effective, and reliable across a large set of transactions yielding 99% of accuracy, and a precision of 87%. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Behavior Analysis; Big Data Analytics; Fraud Detection; Isolation Forest; Online Fraud; Crime; Data Handling; Digital Storage; Large Dataset; Learning Systems; Machine Learning; Open Data; Open Systems; Banking Sectors; Behavior Analysis; Big Data Analytic; Business Models; Data Analytics; End To End; Fraud Detection; Isolation Forest; Online Fraud; Real-time Architecture; Data Analytics","Crime; Data handling; Digital storage; Large dataset; Learning systems; Machine learning; Open Data; Open systems; Banking sectors; Behavior analysis; Big data analytic; Business models; Data analytics; End to end; Fraud detection; Isolation forest; Online fraud; Real-time architecture; Data Analytics","","","","Gahi, Youssef, A secure multi-user database-as-a-service approach for cloud computing privacy, Procedia Computer Science, 160, pp. 811-818, (2019); Singla, Aakriti, A Comparative Approach to Predictive Analytics with Machine Learning for Fraud Detection of Realtime Financial Data, (2020); Malik, Esraa Faisal, Credit Card Fraud Detection Using a New Hybrid Machine Learning Architecture, Mathematics, 10, 9, (2022); Achituve, Idan, Interpretable Online Banking Fraud Detection Based on Hierarchical Attention Mechanism, IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing, MLSP, 2019-October, (2019); Vanini, Paolo, Online payment fraud: from anomaly detection to risk management, Financial Innovation, 9, 1, (2023); Gahi, Youssef, Encrypted processes for oblivious data retrieval, pp. 514-518, (2011); Big Data and Artificial Intelligence in Digital Finance, (2022); Zhou, Hangjun, Internet Financial Fraud Detection Based on a Distributed Big Data Approach with Node2vec, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 43378-43386, (2021); Wang, Haibo, Integrating Machine Learning Algorithms With Quantum Annealing Solvers for Online Fraud Detection, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 75908-75917, (2022); Ullah, Z., A smart secured framework for detecting and averting online recruitment fraud using ensemble machine learning techniques, PeerJ Computer Science, 9, (2023)","","Science and Information Organization","","","","","","21565570; 2158107X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165075106"

India, being an emerging economy with considerable dependence on agriculture both for food security and employment generation, offers an important case study for understanding the macro-economic issues and designing the right set of policy approach for mitigating implications of climate change. Furthermore, unlike other central banks, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) shares a close association with agriculture owing to the continued credit support to the sector as part of its priority sector lending policy, and because it is closely involved in addressing climate change. The paper focuses on the decade of 2010s, the recorded warmest decade till now and adopts a machine learning approach (sequential multivariate adaptive regression splines model) to assess the interaction between climate risk factors and agriculture. To the best of our knowledge, the modelling approach applied in this paper is unique, novel and of the first kind to assess the implications of climate change on agriculture. The results indicate that carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) emission, precipitation, irrigation water used, and rainfall are the most prominent factors affecting different parameters of agricultural production. These factors are taken at the yearly aggregate level and their interactions among themselves, particularly CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, affect productivity of foodgrains and oilseeds, providing a detailed insight about the recent decade of climate change in the context of Indian economy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agriculture; Central Banking; Climate Change; Machine Learning","","","","","Aggarwal, Pramod Kumar, Climate change and rice yields in diverse agro-environments of India.

This issue goes beyond competitiveness and the interrelationship among its members, requiring at least signs or warnings of potential problems in such institutions. Thus, the present study presents some early warning system models for bank crises and bank distress, which are empirically tested for Brazilian banks. In addition to the traditional logit, we analyse two machine learning techniques are: random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). The database of Brazilian banks covers 179 events considered as unsound bank. Our findings suggest that RF and SVM underperform the logit model.

In this work, we consider conventional time series analysis techniques with additional information from the Google Trend website to predict stock price returns. We further utilize a machine learning algorithm, namely Random Forest, to predict the next day closing price of four Greek systemic banks. Methods/Analysis: The financial data considered in this work comprise Open, Close prices of stocks and Trading Volume. In the context of our analysis, these data are further used to create new variables that serve as additional inputs to the proposed machine learning based model. Specifically, we consider variables for each of the banks in the dataset, such as 7 DAYS MA,14 DAYS MA, 21 DAYS MA, 7 DAYS STD DEV and Volume. One step ahead out of sample prediction following the rolling window approach has been applied. Performance evaluation of the proposed model has been done using standard strategic indicators: RMSE and MAPE. Findings: Our results depict that the proposed models effectively predict the stock market prices, providing insight about the applicability of the proposed methodology scheme to various stock market price predictions.

Consequently, there are two primary research goals in this work. The initial goal was to examine the impact of customer segmentation on the accuracy of customer churn prediction in the banking sector using machine learning models. The second objective is to experiment, contrast, and assess which machine learning approaches are most effective in predicting customer churn. Background This paper reviews the theoretical basis of customer churn, and customer segmentation, and suggests using supervised machine-learning techniques for customer attrition prediction. Methodology In this study, we use different machine learning models such as k-means clustering to segment customers, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine to apply to the dataset to predict customer churn. Contribution The results demonstrate that the dataset performs well with the random forest model, with an accuracy of about 97%, and that, following customer segmentation, the mean accuracy of each model performed well, with logistic regression having the lowest accuracy (87.27%) and random forest having the best (97.25%). Findings Customer segmentation does not have much impact on the precision of predictions. It is dependent on the dataset and the models we choose. Recommendations for Practitioners The practitioners can apply the proposed solutions to build a predictive system or apply them in other fields such as education, tourism, marketing, and human resources. Recommendations for Researchers The research paradigm is also applicable in other areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and churn prediction. Impact on Society Customer churn will cause the value flowing from customers to enterprises to decrease. If customer churn continues to occur, the enterprise will gradually lose its competitive advantage. Future Research Build a real-time or near real-time application to provide close information to make good decisions. Furthermore, handle the imbalanced data using new techniques. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking Industry; Churn Prediction; Classification Models; Machine Learning; Smote; Competition; Forecasting; K-means Clustering; Learning Systems; Logistic Regression; Nearest Neighbor Search; Random Forests; Sales; Support Vector Regression; Banking Industry; Banking Sectors; Churn Predictions; Classification Models; Customer Churn Prediction; Customer Churns; Customers Segmentations; Machine Learning Models; Machine-learning; Smote; Decision Trees","Competition; Forecasting; K-means clustering; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Nearest neighbor search; Random forests; Sales; Support vector regression; Banking industry; Banking sectors; Churn predictions; Classification models; Customer churn prediction; Customer churns; Customers segmentations; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; SMOTE; Decision trees","","","This research is funded by University of Economics and Law, Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City.","Alexandropoulos, Stamatios Aggelos N., Data preprocessing in predictive data mining, Knowledge Engineering Review, 34, (2019); Customer Relationship Management the Foundation of Contemporary Marketing Strategy, (2016); Biau, Gérard, A random forest guided tour, Test, 25, 2, pp. 197-227, (2016); Cunningham, Padraig, K-Nearest Neighbour Classifiers-A Tutorial, ACM Computing Surveys, 54, 6, (2022); Dawes, Jillian F., Retention sans frontieres: Issues for financial service retailers, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 17, 1, pp. 36-43, (1999); Dolatabadi, Sepideh Hassankhani, Designing of customer and employee churn prediction model based on data mining method and neural predictor, pp. 74-77, (2017); El Yusufi, Yasyn, Churn Prediction Analysis by Combining Machine Learning Algorithms and Best Features Exploration, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 13, 7, pp. 615-622, (2022); Journal of Applied Microeconometrics, (2021); Hameed, Mazhar, Data Preparation: A Survey of Commercial Tools, SIGMOD Record, 49, 3, pp. 18-29, (2020); Tutorial on Support Vector Machine Svm, (2006)","","Informing Science Institute","","","","","","15551229; 15551237","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151249286"

By using many malicious strategies, the number of malware is steadily increasing. Increasing Android malware threats numerous users, and thus, it is necessary to detect malware quickly and accurately. Each malware has distinguishable characteristics based on its actions. Therefore, security researchers have tried to categorize malware based on their behaviors by conducting the familial analysis which can help analysists to reduce the time and cost for analyzing malware. However, those studies algorithms typically used imbalanced, well-labeled open-source dataset, and thus, it is very difficult to classify some malware families which only have a few number of malware. To overcome this challenge, previous data augmentation studies augmented data by visualizing malicious codes and used them for malware analysis. However, visualization of malware can result in misclassifications because the behavior information of the malware could be compromised. In this study, we propose an android malware familial analysis system based on a data augmentation method that preserves malware behaviors to create an effective multi-class classifier for malware family analysis. To this end, we analyze malware and use Application Programming Interface (APIs) and permissions that can reflect the behavior of malware as features. By using these features, we augment malware dataset to enable effective malware detection while preserving original malicious behaviors. Our evaluation results demonstrate that, when a model is created by using only the augmented data, a macro-F1 score of 0.65 and accuracy of 0.63%. On the other hand, when the augmented data and original malware are used together, the evaluation results show that a macroF1 score of 0.91 and an accuracy of 0.99%. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Android; Artificial Intelligence; Cybersecurity; Data Augmentation; Android (operating System); Application Programming Interfaces (api); Classification (of Information); Cybersecurity; Learning Systems; Mobile Security; Open Source Software; Text Messaging; Android; Android Malware; Auto Encoders; Cyber Security; Data Augmentation; Evaluation Results; Malware Families; Malwares; On-line Banking; Short Message Services","Android (operating system); Application programming interfaces (API); Classification (of information); Cybersecurity; Learning systems; Mobile security; Open source software; Text messaging; Android; Android malware; Auto encoders; Cyber security; Data augmentation; Evaluation results; Malware families; Malwares; On-line banking; Short message services","","","Funding Statement: This work was supported in part by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), and Future Planning under Grant NRF-2020R1A2C2014336 and Grant NRF-2021R1A4A1029650.","Shaukat, Kamran, Performance comparison and current challenges of using machine learning techniques in cybersecurity, Energies, 13, 10, (2020); Shaukat, Kamran, A Survey on Machine Learning Techniques for Cyber Security in the Last Decade, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 222310-222354, (2020); Almomani, Iman Musa, An Automated Vision-Based Deep Learning Model for Efficient Detection of Android Malware Attacks, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 2700-2720, (2022); Mahdavifar, Samaneh, Dynamic Android Malware Category Classification using Semi-Supervised Deep Learning, pp. 515-522, (2020); Nasir, Adeel, What is Core and What Future Holds for Blockchain Technologies and Cryptocurrencies: A Bibliometric Analysis, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 989-1004, (2021); Javed, Iram, V2X-Based Mobile Localization in 3D Wireless Sensor Network, Security and Communication Networks, 2021, (2021); Shaukat, Kamran, A Review on Security Challenges in Internet of Things (IoT), (2021); Transylv Rev, (2017); Hassan, Muhammad Umair, Dear-2: An energy-aware routing protocol with guaranteed delivery in wireless ad-hoc networks, EAI/Springer Innovations in Communication and Computing, pp. 215-224, (2019); Alzaylaee, Mohammed K., DL-Droid: Deep learning based android malware detection using real devices, Computers and Security, 89, (2020)","","Tech Science Press","","","","","","02676192","","CSSEE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148242186"

However, data stored or transmitted in these apps are susceptible to different attacks, threats, and risks. Thus, the need for robust safety mechanisms to cope with these security and privacy challenges. The purpose of this research is to examine the different components of m-banking security that merit investigation, and the vulnerability of present authentication methods in order to propose a more robust verification technique. PRISMA preferred items reporting for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses approach was used in this study. Six databases were utilized; IEEE-Explore, Scopus, EBSCOhost, Taylor & Francis, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. About 1,149 articles were extracted from these databases out of which 38 articles met the review selection criteria, thus included in the review. Findings of the study highlight the efficacy of PRISMA method with regard to items reporting and identification of research gaps compared to the usual literature review. Also, the results of the study found intrusion via other apps stored on mobile devices, and device lost or theft were the main safety and privacy issues. Furthermore, the study findings discovered that the present authentication schemes used by banks are becoming weak and open to various attacks due to an increase in online fraud. Based on the review findings, an Artificial Intelligence-based user authentication and anomalies detection model was proposed which may provide direction for upcoming studies.

Consequently, reducing uncertainty in blood demand, waste, and shortages has become a primary goal. In this paper, we propose a smart platform-oriented approach that will create a robust blood demand and supply chain able to achieve the goals of reducing uncertainty in blood demand by forecasting blood collection/demand, and reducing blood wastage and shortage by balancing blood collection and distribution based on an effective blood inventory management. We use machine learning and time series forecasting models to develop an AI/ML decision support system. It is an effective tool with three main modules that directly and indirectly impact all phases of the blood supply chain: (i) the blood demand forecasting module is designed to forecast blood demand; (ii) blood donor classification helps predict daily unbooked donors thereby enhancing the ability to control the volume of blood collected based on the results of blood demand forecasting; and (iii) scheduling blood donation appointments according to the expected number and type of blood donations, thus improving the quantity of blood by reducing the number of canceled appointments, and indirectly improving the quality and quantity of blood supply by decreasing the number of unqualified donors, thereby reducing the amount of invalid blood after and before preparation. As a result of the system’s improvements, blood shortages and waste can be reduced. The proposed solution provides robust and accurate predictions and identifies important clinical predictors for blood demand forecasting. Compared with the past year’s historical data, our integrated proposed system increased collected blood volume by 11%, decreased inventory wastage by 20%, and had a low incidence of shortages. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Blood Bank Management; Blood Supply Chain; Machine Learning Algorithms; Time Series Forecasting Models; Balancing; Blood; Forecasting; Inventory Control; Learning Algorithms; Machine Learning; Supply Chain Management; Time Series; Bank Managements; Blood Bank; Blood Bank Management; Blood Supply; Blood Supply Chain; Demand Forecasting; Machine Learning Algorithms; Machine-learning; Smart Platform; Time Series Forecasting Models; Decision Support Systems","Balancing; Blood; Forecasting; Inventory control; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Supply chain management; Time series; Bank managements; Blood bank; Blood bank management; Blood supply; Blood supply chain; Demand forecasting; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Smart platform; Time series forecasting models; Decision support systems","","","","Uthayakumar, R., Pharmaceutical supply chain and inventory management strategies: Optimization for a pharmaceutical company and a hospital, Operations Research for Health Care, 2, 3, pp. 52-64, (2013); Privett, Natalie A., The top ten global health supply chain issues: Perspectives from the field, Operations Research for Health Care, 3, 4, pp. 226-230, (2014); Fattahi, Mohammad, Integrated strategic and tactical supply chain planning with price-sensitive demands, Annals of Operations Research, 242, 2, pp. 423-456, (2016); Addis, Bernardetta, Handling uncertainty in health care management using the cardinality-constrained approach: Advantages and remarks, Operations Research for Health Care, 4, pp. 1-4, (2015); Operations Research and Health Care, (2005); Rajendran, Suchithra, Inventory management of platelets along blood supply chain to minimize wastage and shortage, Computers and Industrial Engineering, 130, pp. 714-730, (2019); Li, Na, A decision integration strategy for short-term demand forecasting and ordering for red blood cell components, Operations Research for Health Care, 29, (2021); Williams, Emily P., Modeling of the collections process in the blood supply chain: A literature review, IISE Transactions on Healthcare Systems Engineering, pp. 200-211, (2020); Baş Güre, Seda, Unaddressed problems and research perspectives in scheduling blood collection from donors, Production Planning and Control, 29, 1, pp. 84-90, (2018); Baş Güre, Seda, Management of blood donation system: Literature review and research perspectives, Springer Proceedings in Mathematics and Statistics, 169, pp. 121-132, (2016)","","MDPI","","","","","","20782489","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146720362"

Furthermore, the significant increase in fraud requires high banking transaction costs. As a result, detecting fraudulent activities has become a fascinating topic. In this study, we consider the use of class weight-tuning hyperparameters to control the weight of fraudulent and legitimate transactions. We use Bayesian optimization in particular to optimize the hyperparameters while preserving practical issues such as unbalanced data. We propose weight-tuning as a pre-process for unbalanced data, as well as CatBoost and XGBoost to improve the performance of the LightGBM method by accounting for the voting mechanism. Finally, in order to improve performance even further, we use deep learning to fine-tune the hyperparameters, particularly our proposed weight-tuning one. We perform some experiments on real-world data to test the proposed methods. To better cover unbalanced datasets, we use recall-precision metrics in addition to the standard ROC-AUC. CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost are evaluated separately using a 5-fold cross-validation method. Furthermore, the majority voting ensemble learning method is used to assess the performance of the combined algorithms.

Performance of the bank branches and portfolio managers are also evaluated by the quarterly divided targets to the branches and portfolio managers. In this study, the focus is on performance prediction by using state-of-art machine learning algorithms. A novel automated machine learning approach with combined algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization is also applied for each of the branches since all the branches might have different customer segmentation and behavior. Moreover, the postconditions are executed to finalize the target calculation and distribution over the performance predictions. The study shows the success of the methodology with a successful application of 98% accuracy in the prediction and majority of branch target calculations. An end-to-end solution found to the seasonality and periodicity problem, which is the biggest problem faced by branches while achieving their goals. Also, the novel approach increases the success of branch targets by 10% in overall. The most significant innovation this study provides to the literature and practitioners is that, unlike classical studies, it solves the seasonality and periodicity problem through multiple time series modeling. The target setting procedure was employed by the largest financial institution in Turkey, Ziraat Bank, to evaluate the operating performance of its branches. The empirical study demonstrates the applicability of the proposed model in the banking sector. The outputs of the study are implemented in real life for all retail branches of Ziraat Bank.

The use of artificial intelligence technologies for business process transformation is one of the most promising areas. Artificial intelligence is conductive to not only increasing the business process efficiency, but also to reducing the companies’ costs required for business process implementation. Artificial intelligence also contributes to reducing the need for human resources to perform routine operations. The aim of the study was to make a list of indicators that describe the performance of artificial intelligence technology in the activities of large companies and calculate them based on the example of the banking branch. Credit Agricole — a bank with foreign investment, one of the leaders of the banking sector of Ukraine — was chosen for the study. The methods of statistical and economic analysis were the main research methods used to contrast performance indicators with the use of artificial intelligence and without it. Quantitative indicators such as the duration of the client’s application; the cost of client service; the number of requests processed by the bank’s operators and managers; saving money spent on client service business processes were the main indicators for evaluating the performance of artificial intelligence. The results of the study demonstrated practical advantages of using artificial intelligence, which entail savings of working time and financial resources. These results confirm that the labor productivity of the bank branch employees has increased due to the automation of processes implemented through the artificial intelligence systems and technologies. The study opens up new areas of further research, in particular the impact of the use of artificial intelligence on financial performance and market capitalization of companies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Business Processes; Chatbot; Machine Learning; Voice Bot","","","","","Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning and Big Data in Finance Opportunities Challenges and Implications for Policy Makers, (2021); New Physics of Financial Services, (2018); Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Financial Services, (2017); Artificial Intelligence in Finance, (2019); Artificial Intelligence S Role in Finance and how Financial Companies are Leveraging the Technology to their Advantage, (2020); About Chatbots Types and Examples for Which Business is Suitable A List of Designers to Create Webpromo, (2020); Ekonomichna Pravda, (2020); undefined, (2021); Magazine Pay Space, (2019); International Business Review, (2021)","","World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society","","","","","","11099526; 22242899","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146180026"

Experts in the field of cybercrime are continuously monitoring and verifying network infrastructure and transaction systems. Dedicated threat response teams (CSIRTs) are used by organizations to ensure security and stop cyber attacks. Financial institutions are well aware of this and have increased funding for CSIRTs and antifraud software. If the company has a rule-based antifraud system, the CSIRT can examine fraud cases and create rules to counter the threat. If not, they can attempt to analyze Internet traffic down to the packet level and look for anomalies before adding network rules to proxy or firewall servers to mitigate the threat. However, this does not always solve the issues, because transactions occasionally receive a “gray” rating. Nevertheless, the bank is unable to approve every gray transaction because the number of call center employees is insufficient to make this possible. In this study, we designed a machine-learning-based rating system that provides early warnings against financial fraud. We present the system architecture together with the new ML-based scoring extension, which examines customer logins from the banking transaction system. The suggested method enhances the organization’s rule-based fraud prevention system. Because they occur immediately after the client identification and authorization process, the system can quickly identify gray operations. The suggested method reduces the amount of successful fraud and improves call center queue administration. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autoencoder; Bank Fraud Detection; Csirt; Ids Architecture; Intrusion Detection System; Machine Learning","","","","This study received no external funding.","Cabaj, Krzysztof, Cybersecurity: trends, issues, and challenges, Eurasip Journal on Information Security, 2018, 1, (2018); Srokosz, Michal, A new WAF-based architecture for protecting web applications against CSRF attacks in malicious environment, pp. 391-395, (2018); Kozlowski, Mateusz, A new method of testing machine learning models of detection for targeted DDoS attacks, pp. 728-733, (2021); Sánchez, Marco, FraudFind: Financial fraud detection by analyzing human behavior, 2018-January, pp. 281-286, (2018); Cao, Shaosheng, TitAnt: Online realtime transaction fraud detection in ant financial, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 12, 12, pp. 2082-2093, (2018); Big Data and Artificial Intelligence in Digital Finance, (2022); Powell, Brian A., Detecting malicious logins as graph anomalies, Journal of Information Security and Applications, 54, (2020); Ruff, Lukas, A Unifying Review of Deep and Shallow Anomaly Detection, Proceedings of the IEEE, 109, 5, pp. 756-795, (2021); Hilal, Waleed, Financial Fraud: A Review of Anomaly Detection Techniques and Recent Advances, Expert Systems with Applications, 193, (2022); Siadati, Hossein, Detecting structurally anomalous logins within enterprise networks, Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 1273-1284, (2017)","","MDPI","","","","","","20799292","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145833998"

However, in the literature, how AI affects users' perceptions of social support and the users' satisfaction and continuance intention (CI) remains unknown. To fill this gap, the two core characteristics of AI, perceived intelligence (PI) and perceived anthropomorphism (PA), are combined with social support theory (SST) (including informational support (IS) and emotional support (ES)) to develop a research model to investigate how PI and PA affect IS and ES, which in turn affect users’ M-banking satisfaction and CI. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted a random probability sampling method to collect a total of 360 valid responses to verify the proposed model. Partial least squares (PLS) was employed for data analysis. Findings: The results showed that PI and PA both have a significant positive impact on consumers' perception of social support (IS and ES). IS was a direct driver of satisfaction and CI. Surprisingly, although ES was positively associated with satisfaction, the study found that higher levels of ES will decrease CI. This study exposed how AI affects consumers’ satisfaction and CI through SST, and the role of AI in M-banking applications has been further confirmed. Originality/value: This study expanded the SST to creatively integrate with AI features to reveal the impact of PI and PA on IS and ES, which in turn influence users' M-banking usage. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence (ai); Continuance Intention; Financial Technology (fintech); Mobile Banking; Satisfaction; Social Support Theory; Behavioral Research; Least Squares Approximations; Artificial Intelligence; Continuance Intentions; Emotional Supports; Financial Technology; Informational Support; Mobile Bankings; Satisfaction; Social Support; Social Support Theory; Usage Intention","Behavioral research; Least squares approximations; Artificial intelligence; Continuance intentions; Emotional supports; Financial technology; Informational support; Mobile bankings; Satisfaction; Social support; Social support theory; Usage intention","","","","Al-Otaibi, Sultan, The satisfaction of saudi customers toward mobile banking in Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom, Journal of Global Information Management, 26, 1, pp. 85-103, (2018); Journal of Information Technology Research, (2021); Journal of Marketing Research, (1977); Ashfaq, Muhammad, Understanding Ant Forest continuance: effects of user experience, personal attributes and motivational factors, Industrial Management and Data Systems, 122, 2, pp. 471-498, (2022); Ashraf, Abdul Rehman, Perceived values and motivations influencing m-commerce use: A nine-country comparative study, International Journal of Information Management, 59, (2021); Balakrishnan, Janarthanan, Conversational commerce: entering the next stage of AI-powered digital assistants, Annals of Operations Research, 333, 2-3, pp. 653-687, (2024); Belanche, Daniel, Artificial Intelligence in FinTech: understanding robo-advisors adoption among customers, Industrial Management and Data Systems, 119, 7, pp. 1411-1430, (2019); Bhattacherjee, Anol, Understanding information systems continuance: An expectation-confirmation model, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 25, 3, pp. 351-370, (2001); Bradley, Patrick, Risk management standards and the active management of malicious intent in artificial superintelligence, AI and Society, 35, 2, pp. 319-328, (2020); Brislin, Richard W., Back-translation for cross-cultural research, Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 1, 3, pp. 185-216, (1970)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","20503806; 20503814","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145607199"

Meanwhile, researchers have been attempting to analyze consumer information in-depth to improve the effectiveness of bank telemarketing and attract deposits through telephone communication. In this paper, we construct bank telemarketing prediction models by three machine learning (ML) methods, i.e., Random Subspace (RS), Multi-Boosting (MB) and Random Subspace-Multi-Boosting (RS-MB), and find the best performing model. Also, we make the interpretability analysis to provide banks with decision information to develop and implement an effective marketing plan. We rank the importance of the original independent variables by the ML method and select those variables whose influence on the prediction results was significant. And we reconstruct the bank telemarketing prediction models based on the selected independent variables. Furthermore, we illustrate the marginal effects of the selected independent variables on the consumers’ subscription of deposits by the Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) to analyze how these selected independent variables affect the success of bank telemarketing campaigns. The empirical results indicate that the RS-MB using selected independent variables achieves the best performance for prediction. It is worth noting that banks would rather contact uninterested customers than miss potential deposit customers. Therefore, when predicting the success of telemarketing campaigns, it is more critical to reduce false negative rate than false positive rate. Moreover, banks using telemarketing should pay more attention to type of job that the customer does, the month that the customer was connected, and contact day of week. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank Telemarketing; Interpretability Analysis; Machine Learning; Prediction Performance; Adaptive Boosting; Deposits; Forecasting; Sales; Bank Telemarketing; Independent Variables; Interpretability; Interpretability Analyse; Low-costs; Machine-learning; On-machines; Prediction Modelling; Prediction Performance; Random Subspaces; Machine Learning","Adaptive boosting; Deposits; Forecasting; Sales; Bank telemarketing; Independent variables; Interpretability; Interpretability analyse; Low-costs; Machine-learning; On-machines; Prediction modelling; Prediction performance; Random subspaces; Machine learning","","","This work was supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21ZDA114), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 72271087, 71971079 and 71871088).","Ali, Nageh M., Feature selection approach for failure mode detection of reinforced concrete bridge columns, Case Studies in Construction Materials, 17, (2022); Babin, Barry J., Atmospheric affect as a tool for creating value and gaining share of customer, Journal of Business Research, 49, 2, pp. 91-99, (2000); Baek, Tae Hyun, Stay away from me, Journal of Advertising, 41, 1, pp. 59-76, (2012); Bahl, Aileen, Recursive feature elimination in random forest classification supports nanomaterial grouping, NanoImpact, 15, (2019); Balraadjsing, Surendra, Exploring the potential of in silico machine learning tools for the prediction of acute Daphnia magna nanotoxicity, Chemosphere, 307, (2022); Bolton, Ruth N., A dynamic model of the duration of the customer's relationship with a continuous service provider: The role of satisfaction, Marketing Science, 17, 1, pp. 45-65, (1998); Bose, Indranil Ronnie, Quantitative models for direct marketing: A review from systems perspective, European Journal of Operational Research, 195, 1, pp. 1-16, (2009); Breiman, Leo, Bagging predictors, Machine Learning, 24, 2, pp. 123-140, (1996); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Bunkhumpornpat, Chumphol, Safe-level-SMOTE: Safe-level-synthetic minority over-sampling technique for handling the class imbalanced problem, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5476 LNAI, pp. 475-482, (2009)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03608352","","CINDD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144352606"

Their growth is often limited by the difficulty in obtaining financing. Basel II accords enforced the obligation for banks to estimate the probability of default of their obligors. Currently used models are limited by the simplicity of their architecture and the available data. State of the art machine learning models are not widely used because they are often considered as black boxes that cannot be easily explained or interpreted. We propose a methodology to combine high predictive power and powerful explainability using various Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) implementations and Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values as post-prediction explanation model. This method is developed and tested using a nation-wide sample of French companies, and a history of past failures extracted from commercial court decisions. The performances of GBDT models are compared with traditional credit scoring algorithms. GBDT provides the best performances over the test sample, while being fast to train and economically sound. Results obtained from SHAP values analysis are consistent with previous socio-economic studies. Providing such a level of explainability to complex models may convince regulators to accept their use in automated credit scoring. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Credit Scoring; Gradient Boosting; Interpretability; Machine Learning; Smes; Banking; Credit Provision; Industrial Development; Industrial Investment; Lending Behavior; Machine Learning; Small And Medium-sized Enterprise; Socioeconomic Conditions; France","banking; credit provision; industrial development; industrial investment; lending behavior; machine learning; small and medium-sized enterprise; socioeconomic conditions; France","","","","Altman, Edward I., FINANCIAL RATIOS, DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS AND THE PREDICTION OF CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY, Journal of Finance, 23, 4, pp. 589-609, (1968); Altman, Edward I., ZETATM analysis A new model to identify bankruptcy risk of corporations, Journal of Banking and Finance, 1, 1, pp. 29-54, (1977); Altman, Edward I., Modelling credit risk for SMEs: Evidence from the U.S. market, Abacus, 43, 3, pp. 332-357, (2007); Available at Ssrn, (2008); Aziz, Abdul, BANKRUPTCY PREDICTION ‐ AN INVESTIGATION OF CASH FLOW BASED MODELS, Journal of Management Studies, 25, 5, pp. 419-437, (1988); Beck, Thorsten, Small and medium-size enterprises: Access to finance as a growth constraint, Journal of Banking and Finance, 30, 11, pp. 2931-2943, (2006); Bank Financing for Smes Around the World Drivers Obstacles Business Models and Lending Practices, (2008); Beck, Thorsten, Bank Financing for SMEs - Lessons from the Literature, National Institute Economic Review, 225, 1, pp. R23-R38, (2013); Proceedings of the 1990 Deloitte Touche University of Kansas Symposium on Auditing Problems, (1990); Berger, Allen N., Small business credit availability and relationship lending: The importance of bank organisational structure, Economic Journal, 112, 477, pp. F32-F53, (2002)","","Routledge","","","","","","14664283; 00036846","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133688803"

Data were obtained from the annual reports, complemented with additional financial information provided by the Portuguese Banking Association. The population consists of 58 messages from the management board obtained for 11 banks that operated in Portugal between 2009 and 2017. The information was collected using artificial intelligence tools. The findings are consistent with the identification of thematic manipulation strategies. The results confirm that the tone used by the Portuguese financial sector entities is in line with the macroeconomic evolution, as well as confirm that the corporate governance structure plays a big influence on the management discourse. In contrast, entities with a stronger level of corporate governance showed a less positive tone. Lastly, entities with higher liquidity and impaired assets tend to have a more positive tone. This study brings an innovative perspective regarding the methodology adopted, being pioneered in the application of technology under impression management studies in Portugal. Thus, future analyses may use these tools to mitigate errors and subjectivity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Banking Sector; Impression Management; Letters To Shareholders; Thematic Manipulation","","","","This work was supported by the ISCAL - Instituto Politécnico de Lisboa, and it was developed in the context of the project IPL/2022/REPUKRAINE _ISCAL.","Research Journal of Finance and Accounting, (2014); Abrahamson, Eric, The information content of the president's letter to shareholders, Journal of Business Finance and Accounting, 23, 8, pp. 1157-1182, (1996); Academy of Management Journal, (1994); Abed, Ibtihal A., Creative Accounting Determination and Financial Reporting Quality: The Integration of Transparency and Disclosure, Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity, 8, 1, (2022); Bank Performance and Credit Risk Management, (2008); Aerts, Walter, Picking up the pieces: Impression management in the retrospective attributional framing of accounting outcomes, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 30, 6, pp. 493-517, (2005); Ahamed, M.

This paper proposes an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model for predicting credit default on a unique dataset of unsecured consumer loans provided by a Norwegian bank. We combined a LightGBM model with SHAP, which enables the interpretation of explanatory variables affecting the predictions. The LightGBM model clearly outperforms the bank’s actual credit scoring model (Logistic Regression). We found that the most important explanatory variables for predicting default in the LightGBM model are the volatility of utilized credit balance, remaining credit in percentage of total credit and the duration of the customer relationship. Our main contribution is the implementation of XAI methods in banking, exploring how these methods can be applied to improve the interpretability and reliability of state-of-the-art AI models.

The aim of this paper is to employ a variety of machine-learning algorithms to identify the main determinants of bank default and to understand the impact of each variable on it. Bank default is one of the most studied topics in financial literature because of the severity of its consequences on the whole economic system. However, little attention has been paid to the identification of the major determinants of bank failures via machine-learning approaches. This paper employs several machine-learning algorithms, including a graph neural network that has never been used in a financial context. Another novelty is the implementation of a balanced dataset by customising the heuristic oversampling method based on k-means and synthetic minority over-sampling technique. This paper also deals with the inclusion of competition among the possible default determinants. The dataset consists of all the banks in the Euro Area in the period 2018–2020.

We cover a total of 100 countries, advanced and emerging, over the years from 1970 to 2017. The paper first shows that AdaBoost has a better predictive performance than the logit model, both in-sample and out-of-sample; then, it employs AdaBoost to classify the major macroeconomic factors leading to banking crises. The baseline analysis reveals that the US 10 yr Treasury interest rate and world growth play a key role in anticipating a crisis, and that these two variables explain a growing share of the results over time, for both country groups. Other variables, which have been highlighted as important in the literature on crises - such as inflation, current account, public and external debt and credit - are relevant in the lead up to banking crises, but their role has been decreasing over time compared to the aforementioned variables. We also present extensions of the model, which confirm and add to the main results of the baseline model. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking Crises; Machine Learning; Predictive Models","","","","We thank the editor and two anonymous referees for their valuable comments.

The present study performs a scientific bibliometric analysis of research on banking risk till data. Research has been conducted on five major types of banking risks – credit, operational, market, liquidity, and interest rate risk – from 967 publications on Scopus database from 1967 to 2021. The results suggest that the research in the area is dominated by the United States, the United Kingdom, and China. The publications in top journals in the domain of finance and economics are less, but the number has increased after 2008–2009. The paper also performs content analysis on top-cited papers of five risk categories to find major themes and theoretical, practical, and methodological contributions. These findings suggest scope for more research in risks other than credit and operating risks, as existing research is centred around modelling risk and predicting default rates. Researchers in the area should focus on programming and machine learning tools. Regarding policy implications, the research identifies key publications in risk modelling, which can be used as the basis of improved supervisory mechanisms and internal controls. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking; Database; Financial Crisis; Machine Learning; Risk Assessment; China; United Kingdom; United States","banking; database; financial crisis; machine learning; risk assessment; China; United Kingdom; United States","","","","Abdul-Rahman, Aisyah, Does financing structure affects bank liquidity risk?, Pacific Basin Finance Journal, 52, pp. 26-39, (2018); Acharya, Sankarshan, Value of latent risk and decision to hedge, Banks and Bank Systems, 2, 4, pp. 66-83, (2007); Acheampong, Albert, Does soft information determine credit risk?

Automated cyberbullying detection techniques need to be designed to remove the potential tragedies in OSNs. The recent advent of artificial intelligence (AI) models like machine learning and deep learning (DL) models can be employed for the detection of cyberbullying in the OSN. With this motivation, this paper develops an AI-enabled cyberbullying-free OSN (AICBF-ONS) technique in smart cities. The proposed AICBF-ONS technique involves chaotic salp swarm optimization (CSSO)-based feature selection technique to derive a useful set of features from the OSN data. In addition, stacked autoencoder model is used as a classification model to allocate appropriate class labels of the OSN data. To improve the detection performance of the SAE model, a parameter tuning process take place using the mayfly optimization (MFO) algorithm. An extensive experimental analysis ensured the supremacy of the proposed AICBF-ONS technique. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Cyberbullying; Deep Learning; Online Social Networks; Smart Cities; Sustainability; Computer Crime; Deep Learning; E-learning; Smart City; Virtual Reality; Cyber Bullying; Cyberspaces; E- Commerces; Intelligence Models; Learning Models; Network Data; On-line Banking; Physical World; Virtual Worlds; Social Networking (online)","Computer crime; Deep learning; E-learning; Smart city; Virtual reality; Cyber bullying; Cyberspaces; E- commerces; Intelligence models; Learning models; Network data; On-line banking; Physical world; Virtual worlds; Social networking (online)","","","","Das, Kousik, Study on centrality measures in social networks: a survey, Social Network Analysis and Mining, 8, 1, (2018); Mahapatra, Rupkumar, Link prediction in social networks by neutrosophic graph, International Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems, 13, 1, pp. 1699-1713, (2020); Lytras, Miltiadis D., Social networks research for sustainable smart education, Sustainability (Switzerland), 10, 9, (2018); Samanta, Sovan, A study on semi-directed graphs for social media networks, International Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems, 14, 1, pp. 1034-1041, (2021); Mahapatra, Rupkumar, RSM index: A new way of link prediction in social networks, Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 37, 2, pp. 2137-2151, (2019); Int J Knowl Soc Res, (2016); Kumari, Kirti, Aggressive Social Media Post Detection System Containing Symbolic Images, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 11701 LNCS, pp. 415-424, (2019); John, Ann, Self-harm, suicidal behaviours, and cyberbullying in children and young people: Systematic review, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 20, 4, (2018); Whittaker, Elizabeth, Cyberbullying Via Social Media, Journal of School Violence, 14, 1, pp. 11-29, (2015); Rosa, Hugo, Automatic cyberbullying detection: A systematic review, Computers in Human Behavior, 93, pp. 333-345, (2019)","","Atlantis Press","","","","","","18756891; 18756883","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123591848"

The methods are evaluated by withholding measured poverty rates and determining how accurately the methods predict the held-out data. A simple approach that scales the last observed welfare distribution by a fraction of real GDP per capita growth performs nearly as well as models using statistical learning on 1,000+ variables. This GDP-based approach outperforms all models that predict poverty rates directly, even when the last survey is up to five years old.

There is tremendous financial growth and advancement in developing countries, resulting in a high demand for personal loans from citizens. Depending on their needs, many people seek personal loans from banks. However, it is difficult for banks to predict which consumers will pay their bills and which will not since the number of bank frauds in many countries, notably India, is growing. According to the Reserve Bank of India, the Indian banking industry uncovered INR 71,500 in the scam in the fiscal year 2018–2019. The average lag time between the date of the occurrence and its recognition by banks, according to the statistics, was 22 months. This is despite harsher warnings from both the RBI and the government, particularly in the aftermath of the Nirav Modi debacle. To overcome this issue, we demonstrated how to create a predictive loan model that identifies problematic candidates who are considerably more likely to pay the money back. In step-by-step methods, we illustrated how to handle raw data, remove unneeded portions, choose appropriate features, gather exploratory statistics, and finally how to construct a model. In this work, we created supervised learning models such as decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). According to the classification report, the models with the highest accuracy score, f-score, precision, and recall are considered the best among all models. However, in this work, our primary aim was to reduce the false-positive parameter in the classification models’ confusion matrix to reduce the banks’ non-performing assets (NPA), which is helpful to the banking sector. The data were graphed to help bankers better understand the customer’s behavior. Thus, using the same method, client loyalty may also be anticipated. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Credit Card Fraud; Financial Crime; Fraud Prediction; Machine Learning; Non-performing Assets; Outlier Detection; Algorithm; Banking; Detection Method; Developing World; Economic Growth; Economic Impact; Gross Domestic Product; Machine Learning; Supervised Learning; India","algorithm; banking; detection method; developing world; economic growth; economic impact; Gross Domestic Product; machine learning; supervised learning; India","","","This research was supported by the Future University Researchers Supporting Project Number FUESP-2020/48 at Future University in Egypt, New Cairo 11845, Egypt.","Ph D Thesis, (2022); Li, Yu, Credit risk prediction based on machine learning methods, pp. 1011-1013, (2019); Zhu, Lin, A study on predicting loan default based on the random forest algorithm, Procedia Computer Science, 162, pp. 503-513, (2019); Vojtek, Martin, Credit scoring methods, Finance a Uver - Czech Journal of Economics and Finance, 56, 3-4, pp. 152-167, (2006); Sourabh, A Review of Credit Card Fraud Detection Techniques, Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering, 832, pp. 485-496, (2022); Rehman, Ateeq Ur, Weighted Based Trustworthiness Ranking in Social Internet of Things by using Soft Set Theory, pp. 1644-1648, (2019); International Journal of Advanced Science and Technology, (2014); Breeden, Joseph L., A survey of machine learning in credit risk, Journal of Credit Risk, 17, 3, pp. 1-62, (2021); Madaan, Mehul, Loan default prediction using decision trees and random forest: A comparative study, IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 1022, 1, (2021); International Journal of Engineering and Techniques, (2019)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141863208"

However, academic research substantially lags behind the adoption of AI in practice. At the beginning of this century, AI research has been centered on the sector's credit risk. In the 2010s decade, expert systems were increasingly replaced by data-driven, “algorithmic” AI. Big data enjoyed much hype in that decade, which diminished later mostly due to unsuccessful implementations. Much published research on big data actually relates to machine and deep learning but not to big data per se. These terms are often found to be conflated in research and practice. The insurance sector is substantially underrepresented in published AI research, and current research is dominated by banking and investments. Governance frameworks for “responsible AI” (RAI) are yet to be incorporated into practice by fintech companies as well as incumbent organizations. RAI is a particular issue for decentralized finance (DeFi). The most successful implementations of AI in BFSI practice, as well as dominant academic research areas, are in investments, securities, market making, customer relationships, lending, risk management, and compliance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Banking; Financial Services; Fintech; Insurance; Systematic Science Mapping","","","","","Adb Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration, (2008); undefined, (2020); Adewumi, Aderemi O., A survey of machine-learning and nature-inspired based credit card fraud detection techniques, International Journal of System Assurance Engineering and Management, 8, pp. 937-953, (2017); Adnani, Hinde, Similarity Indexes for Scientometric Research: A Comparative Analysis, Malaysian Journal of Library and Information Science, 25, 3, pp. 31-48, (2020); Redefining Banking and Financial Industry Through the Application of Computational Intelligence in Proceedings of the 2019 Advances in Science and Engineering Technology International Conferences Aset, (2019); Aguinis, Herman, What you see is what you get?

We first compare the statistical performance of five models based on supervised learning like Logistic Lasso, Trees (CART), Random Forest, XGBoost and Deep Learning, with a well-known model like Logit. We measure the statistical performance through different metrics, and for different sample sizes and features available. We find that ML models outperform, even when relatively low amount of data is used. We then translate this statistical performance into economic impact by estimating the savings in capital when using an advanced ML model instead of a simpler one to compute the risk-weighted assets following the Internal Ratings Based (IRB) approach. Our benchmark results show that implementing XGBoost instead of Logistic Lasso could yield savings from 12.4% to 17% in terms of regulatory capital requirements. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Credit Risk; Irb System; Machine Learning; Prediction; Probability Of Default","","","","","Economic Studies at Brookings, (2021); Predicting Consumer Default A Deep Learning Approach, (2019); Alonso-Robisco, Andrés, Measuring the model risk-adjusted performance of machine learning algorithms in credit default prediction, Financial Innovation, 8, 1, (2022); Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Principles for the Use of Algorithms in Decision Making Processes, (2021); undefined, (2022); Bartlett, Robert P., Consumer-lending discrimination in the FinTech Era, Journal of Financial Economics, 143, 1, pp. 30-56, (2022); Variability in Risk Weighted Assets What does the Market Think Bis Working Papers no 844, (2020); Large Scale Kernel Machines, (2007); Conference on the Impact of Machine Learning and AI on the Uk Economy, (2020); Studies on the Validation of Internal Rating Systems, (2005)","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","10575219","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138219236"

This study has developed a new feature selection-based data envelopment analysis (DEA) model to calculate the efficiencies and predict the stress of Indian banks. The feature selection-based data envelopment analysis (DEA) model combines feature selection methodology (a machine learning technique), with the traditional data envelopment analysis. The proposed model is able to map the DEA ranks, and the status of both failure and success of banks, and other similar decision-making units (DMUs). It also helps in solving the problems associated with the selection of appropriate input and output features as well as the time-dependent data points which usually have a lagged effect. The proposed model is applicable only when appropriate samples of past data of DMUs performance are available, whereby it maps both the input and output features with performance. Importantly, while dealing with the past data for selecting the appropriate inputs and outputs, it is imperative to select all the indicators that affect the performance of DMUs and thereby reduce the number of features using the machine learning approach. The proposed model is one of its kind, integrating a machine learning technique to a nonparametric frontier decision model. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Envelopment Analysis; Feature Selection; Machine Learning; Relief Algorithm","","","","","Adler, Nicole, Including principal component weights to improve discrimination in data envelopment analysis, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 53, 9, pp. 985-991, (2002); Adler, Nicole, Review of ranking methods in the data envelopment analysis context, European Journal of Operational Research, 140, 2, pp. 249-265, (2002); Feature Extraction Construction and Selection A Data Mining Perspective, (1998); Aldamak, Abdullah M., Review of efficiency ranking methods in data envelopment analysis, Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation, 106, pp. 161-172, (2017); Alqahtani, Faisal, Islamic bank efficiency compared to conventional banks during the global crisis in the GCC region, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 51, pp. 58-74, (2017); Amirteimoori, Alireza, Data envelopment analysis in dynamic framework, Applied Mathematics and Computation, 181, 1, pp. 21-28, (2006); Angulo-Meza, Lidia, Review of methods for increasing discrimination in data envelopment analysis, Annals of Operations Research, 116, 1-4, pp. 225-242, (2002); Aviles-Sacoto, Sonia Valeria, Two-stage network DEA: When intermediate measures can be treated as outputs from the second stage, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 66, 11, pp. 1868-1877, (2015); Avkiran, Necmi Kemal, An illustration of dynamic network DEA in commercial banking including robustness tests, Omega (United Kingdom), 55, pp. 141-150, (2015); Sensitivity and Stability in Stochastic Data Envelopment, (2015)","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","","","","","14791854; 14723891","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104383872"

In this paper, we argue that data coming from housing sales advertisements (ads) websites can be used to overcome some existing deficiencies. Using a large data set of ads in Italy, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the problems and potential of these data. We show how machine learning tools can correct a specific bias of online listings, namely the proliferation of duplicate ads that refer to the same housing unit, increasing the representativeness and reliability of these data.

These are common problems in e-banking and online transactions. However, as the financial sector evolves, so do the methods for fraud and anomalies. Moreover, blockchain technology is being introduced as the most secure method integrated into finance. However, along with these advanced technologies, many frauds are also increasing every year. Therefore, we propose a secure fraud detection model based on machine learning and blockchain. There are two machine learning algorithms—XGboost and random forest (RF)—used for transaction classification. The machine learning techniques train the dataset based on the fraudulent and integrated transaction patterns and predict the new incoming transactions. The blockchain technology is integrated with machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions in the Bitcoin network. In the proposed model, XGboost and random forest (RF) algorithms are used to classify transactions and predict transaction patterns. We also calculate the precision and AUC of the models to measure the accuracy. A security analysis of the proposed smart contract is also performed to show the robustness of our system. In addition, an attacker model is also proposed to protect the proposed system from attacks and vulnerabilities. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anomaly Detection; Blockchain; Fraud Detection; Machine Learning; Random Forest; Xgboost; Anomaly Detection; Bitcoin; Crime; Decision Trees; Distributed Ledger; Machine Learning; Random Forests; Block-chain; Detection Mechanism; E-banking; Fraud Detection; Machine Learning Algorithms; Machine-learning; Transaction Patterns; Xgboost; Blockchain; Algorithm; Fraud; Machine Learning; Technology; Algorithms; Fraud; Machine Learning; Technology","Anomaly detection; Bitcoin; Crime; Decision trees; Distributed ledger; Machine learning; Random forests; Block-chain; Detection mechanism; E-banking; Fraud detection; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Transaction patterns; Xgboost; Blockchain; algorithm; fraud; machine learning; technology; Algorithms; Fraud; Machine Learning; Technology","","","The authors would like to acknowledge the support of Norwegian University of Science and Technology for paying the Article Processing Charges (APC) of this publication.

We exploit a data set combining Gallup World Polls and Global Findex surveys for some 250,000 individuals in 140 countries, merging them with information on the incidence of epidemics and local 3G Internet infrastructure. Epidemic exposure is associated with an increase in remote-access (online/mobile) banking and substitution from bank branch based to ATM activity. The temporary nature of the effects we identify is more consistent with a demand channel rather than that of supply with high initial fixed costs. Exploring heterogeneity using a machine learning–driven approach, we find that young, high-income earners in full-time employment have the greatest tendency to shift to online/mobile transactions in response to epidemics. Baseline effects are larger for individuals with better ex ante 3G signal coverage, highlighting the role of the digital divide in adaption to new technologies necessitated by adverse external shocks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking; Epidemics; Fintech","","","","","Aker, Jenny C., Payment mechanisms and antipoverty programs: Evidence from a mobile money cash transfer experiment in Niger, Economic Development and Cultural Change, 65, 1, pp. 1-37, (2016); Al-Somali, Sabah Abdullah, An investigation into the acceptance of online banking in Saudi Arabia, Technovation, 29, 2, pp. 130-141, (2009); Anderson, Michael L., Multiple inference and gender differences in the effects of early intervention: A reevaluation of the Abecedarian, Perry Preschool, and Early Training Projects, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 103, 484, pp. 1481-1495, (2008); Athey, Susan, Recursive partitioning for heterogeneous causal effects, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 113, 27, pp. 7353-7360, (2016); Aea Papers and Proceedings, (2018); Baptista, Gonçalo, Understanding mobile banking: The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology combined with cultural moderators, Computers in Human Behavior, 50, pp. 418-430, (2015); Gallup, (2020); Learning to Navigate A New Financial Technology Evidence from Payroll Accounts, (2020); Callen, Michael, What Are the Headwaters of Formal Savings?

Our results show that even short pieces of user-generated text can improve credit default predictions significantly. The importance of text is further supported by an information fusion analysis. Compared with other approaches that use text, deep learning outperforms them in almost all cases. However, machine learning models combined with word frequencies or topic models also extract substantial credit-relevant information. A comparison of six deep neural network architectures, including state-of-the-art transformer models, finds that the architectures mostly provide similar performance.

The primary aim of this paper is to propose a measure based on counterfactuals to evaluate the interpretability of a ML credit scoring technique. Counterfactuals assist with understanding the model with regard to the classification decision boundaries and evaluate model robustness. The second contribution is the development of a data perturbation technique to generate a stress scenario. We apply these two proposals to a dataset on UK unsecured personal loans to compare logistic regression and stochastic gradient boosting (SBG). We show that training a blackbox model (SGB) as conditioned on our data perturbation technique can provide insight into model performance under stressed scenarios.

Artificial Intelligence supports institutions including Islamic Financial Services in learning, making decision, and providing useful predictive analytics. The progress and promise that artificial intelligence has made and presented in finance have so far been remarkable, allowing for cheaper, faster, closer, more accessible, more lucrative, and more efficient finance especially during the pandemic covid-19 when people are required to stay at home yet still doing a banking transaction. Despite the incredible progress and promise made possible by advances in financial artificial intelligence, it nevertheless presents some serious perils and limitations. Three categories of risks and limitations involve the rise of virtual threats and cyber conflicts in the financial system, society behavioural changes, and legal amendments that cannot respond to technological developments, especially in developing countries. The main objective of this article is to evaluate the operations of the potential risks that may arise in the use of Artificial Intelligence in Islamic finance services, especially dealing with the legal arrangement that is supposed to be in line with business development. Indonesia is a country that adheres to civil law system, in which every legal arrangement is supposed to be based on written law. The lack of this legal system is where the speed of legal changes cannot keep up with the pace of technological development, which is present as a hinder to the development of Artificial Intelligence in the financial system. This article concludes that Artificial Intelligence will have a huge impact in the future on the Islamic Finance industry, but in Indonesian context, it still needs various efforts to reduce the potential risk that eventually has a big impact on the progress of Islamic banks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Islamic Finance; Legal Arrangement; Potential Risk.","","","","","Jurnal Komunikasi Hukum, (2021); Artificial Intelligence Untuk Perbankan, (2018); Asper Review, (2019); Tanjungpura Law Journal, (2019); Engineering International, (2017); Jurnal Manajemen Dan Bisnis, (2020); Diponegoro Law Review, (2018); Jurnal Banquesyari, (2020); Roles of Big Data and Machine Learning in Bank Supervision, (2018); Fordham Law Review, (2019)","","University of Muhammadiyah Malang","","","","","","25494600; 08546509","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159804036"

With m-banking, the banks can cut down on operational costs whilst maintaining client satisfaction. This research examined the most crucial factors that could predict the Jordanian customer’s continued intention toward the use of m-banking. Following the proposed model, the research was conducted by using a self-conducted questionnaire and the responses were collected electronically from a convenience sample of 403 Jordanian customers of m-banking through social networks. The suggested model was adapted from the theory of planned behavior (TPB), the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), and the technology acceptance model (TAM). The research model was further expanded by considering the factors of service quality and moderating factors (age, gender, educational level, and Internet experience). The collected data of customers were analyzed, validated, and verified by using a structural equation modeling (SME) approach including a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), in addition to machine learning (ML) methods, artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SMO), bagging reduced error pruning tree (RepTree), and random forest. Results showed that effort expectancy, performance expectancy, perceived risk, perceived trust, social influence, and service quality impacted behavioral intention, whereas facilitating conditions did not. Furthermore, behavioral intention impacted upon word of mouth and facilitating conditions (the latter regarding the continued intention to use m-banking), and had the highest coefficient value.

In this paper, we focus on the novel functionality of BotSense Mobile: the detection of malware applications on a user device. In addition to the standard blacklist approach, we propose a machine learning-based model for unknown malicious application detection. The lightweight neural network model is deployed on an edge device to avoid sending sensitive user data outside the device. For the same reason, manifest-related features can be used by the detector only.

There is plenty of research on AI-mediated banking services, but the existing discussions are cumbersome, and studies on AI's service features in banking for emerging markets are limited. Furthermore, the ongoing discussions are centred on developed markets where automation in banking services is noteworthy and accepted. Through this paper, the authors emphasise the relevance of AI mediation in emerging markets and the possible role of strategising AI in banking services for personalised experiences. Design/methodology/approach: The authors' article followed an exploratory, inductive approach through in-depth interviews and thematic analysis. In total, 36 financial experts were interviewed, and the relevant perspectives were analysed to develop the research process and framework for a personalised banking experience. Findings: The authors' paper introduced five key themes and presented those themes accordingly. The first theme details the importance of AI-mediated banking and the skills necessary for operational capacity. The second theme is on the relevance of AI-mediated banking awareness amongst users. The third is about channelling the importance of AI-driven interfaces through managers and employees. Fourth, the authors emphasised the relevance of human intervention due to users' demographic patterns. The fifth theme led to a discussion on personalised AI-mediated banking services. Research limitations/implications: The authors recommend that managers understand the relevance of quality service amongst users. The authors' paper discusses the relevance of AI and human intervention in banking services; however, the process for seamless, personalised banking experiences is not provided. Thus, this paper encourages managers to build a banking ecosystem that delivers a seamless banking experience through AI. Originality/value: The authors' paper highlights the importance of human intervention in AI-driven banking by introducing personalised service experience elements and highlighting the role of customer experience in AI-driven banking services in emerging markets. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Banking Services; Customer Experience; Personalised Banking Services","","","","The authors are incredibly grateful to the editor, special issue guest editors and anonymous reviewers who helped to elevate the manuscript's quality.

Findings: Through three studies, the findings document that, in a financial decision-making context, anthropomorphizing AI leads to significantly greater risk aversion in investment decision-making (Study 1). This occurs because AI-enabled chatbot anthropomorphization activates greater psychological risk attachment, which enacts consumers to manifest stronger risk aversion tendency (Studies 2 and 3).

The moderating effect of gender on these relationships was also examined. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 430 Canadians responded to an online questionnaire after interacting with a chatbot in the context of a simulated auto insurance quote. A structural equation model was used to test the hypotheses. Findings: The results showed that privacy concerns are influenced primarily by creepiness, followed by perceived risk and the need for privacy. The last two relationships are moderated by gender. Conversely, familiarity with chatbots does not affect privacy concerns in this context. Originality/value: This study is the first to consider the influence of creepiness as an antecedent of privacy concerns arising from interactions with AI tools and highlight its key impacts.

This research studies the impact of technology usage and acceptance of AI-enabled banking CRM systems in Nigeria on consumer buying behavior via the mediation of customer satisfaction and service quality. The study also investigates the negative impact of technology downtime, a frequent phenomenon in the emerging market, which has not, to this point, been studied on a large scale. Design/methodology/approach: The authors collect quantitative data via a face-to-face administered questionnaire from four hundred customers of ten different Nigerian banks regarding their perceptions of technology use in the banking sector. Findings: While the research finds that technology usage has positive and direct effects on service quality, customer satisfaction and consumer buying behavior, service quality was found not to have a significant effect on consumer buying behavior. The study also establishes that technology downtime has a moderating effect on technology usage, consumer buying behavior and customer satisfaction in the banking context. Originality/value: Scant literature exists that explores the importance of culture in technology usage and acceptance, specifically in developing countries like Nigeria. This study explores the impact of technology usage along with acceptance in the Nigerian setting on Nigerian consumers and their resulting satisfaction. Technology usage has been known to impact customer satisfaction in various ways, but no study has looked specifically at how technology in the banking sector can further be of help or harm from a Nigerian perspective. This study explores the technology usage in banking sector of Nigeria and its impact on the consumer buying behaviour. No studies in our knowledge have been known to consider the role of technology downtime, a frequent phenomenon in emerging market, as a factor, which will affect the customer satisfaction and buying behavior. Thus, this study (1a) explores the negative outcomes of technology downtime on both service quality and customer satisfaction, (b) explores the moderating relationship of technology downtime on the technology usage and consumer-related outcomes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Banking Sector; Consumer Behavior; Disruptive Technology; Service Quality; Structural Equation Modeling; Tam; Technology Acceptance","","","","","Abdulquadri, Abdulazeez Olamide, Digital transformation in financial services provision: a Nigerian perspective to the adoption of chatbot, Journal of Enterprising Communities, 15, 2, pp. 258-281, (2021); Adekunle, Simon Ayo, Modelling repurchase intention among smartphones users in Nigeria, Journal of Modelling in Management, 13, 4, pp. 794-814, (2018); Action Control from Cognition to Behavior, (1985); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Akter, Shahriar, Development and validation of an instrument to measure user perceived service quality of mHealth, Information and Management, 50, 4, pp. 181-195, (2013); Al-Somali, Sabah Abdullah, An investigation into the acceptance of online banking in Saudi Arabia, Technovation, 29, 2, pp. 130-141, (2009); International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security, (2018); International Journal of Economics and Financial Modelling, (2016); Anderson, James C., Structural Equation Modeling in Practice: A Review and Recommended Two-Step Approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Athanassopoulos, Antreas D., Behavioural responses to customer satisfaction: an empirical study, European Journal of Marketing, 35, 5-6, pp. 687-707, (2001)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","02652323","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130111154"

Design/methodology/approach: A review of the extant literature is conducted, yielding seven hypotheses underpinned by affect-as-information theory. The hypotheses are tested via three online scenario-based experiments (n = 801) using Process Macro. Findings: The results of the three experiments reveal consumers experience lower levels of positive emotions, specifically, affection, when financial advice is provided by AI in comparison to human employees. Secondly, across the three experiments, conservative consumers are shown to perceive somewhat similar levels of affection in financial advice provided by AI and human employees. Whereas liberal consumers perceive significantly lower levels of affection when serviced by AI in comparison to conservatives and human employee financial advice. Thirdly, results reveal affection and trust to be serial mediators which explain consumers' WOM and brand attitudes when financial services are provided by AI. Fourthly, the investment type plays an important role in consumers’ reactions to the use of AI. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research is one of the first to study political ideology as a potential moderator of consumers’ responses to AI in financial services, providing novel contributions to the literature. It further contributes unique insights by examining emotional responses to AI and human financial advice for different amounts and types of investments using a comprehensive approach of examining both valence and discrete emotions to identify affection as a key explanatory emotion. The study further sheds insights relating to how emotions (affection) and trust mediate the relationship between AI and WOM, and brand attitudes, demonstrating an affect-attitude psychological sequence that explains consumers’ reactions to AI in financial services. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Financial Services; Political Ideology; Word-of-mouth","","","","","International Journal of Financial Services Management, (2006); Abdulquadri, Abdulazeez Olamide, Digital transformation in financial services provision: a Nigerian perspective to the adoption of chatbot, Journal of Enterprising Communities, 15, 2, pp. 258-281, (2021); Adam, Martin, AI-based chatbots in customer service and their effects on user compliance, Electronic Markets, 31, 2, pp. 427-445, (2021); Agogo, David, “How does tech make you feel?” a review and examination of negative affective responses to technology use, European Journal of Information Systems, 27, 5, pp. 570-599, (2018); Aharoni, Eyal, Social reactions toward people vs. computers: How mere lables shape interactions, Computers in Human Behavior, 23, 5, pp. 2175-2189, (2007); Ahmad, Fayez, Brand equity, online reviews, and message trust: the moderating role of persuasion knowledge, Journal of Product and Brand Management, 30, 4, pp. 549-564, (2020); Albarracín, Dolores, Affect as Information in Persuasion: A Model of Affect Identification and Discounting, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 84, 3, pp. 453-469, (2003); Aldlaigan, Abdullah H., Consumer involvement in financial services: An empirical test of two measures, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 19, 6, pp. 232-245, (2001); Aloud, Monira Essa, Investment opportunities forecasting: A genetic programming-based dynamic portfolio trading system under a directional-change framework, Journal of Computational Finance, 22, 1, pp. 1-35, (2018); Andriole, Stephen J., AI: The good, the disruptive, and the scary, Cutter Business Technology Journal, 31, 2, pp. 6-10, (2018)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","02652323","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129138237"

Design/methodology/approach: In an online experiment, 329 Saudi participants were randomly assigned to one of two checkout conditions (traditional vs. AI-enabled) in a between-subjects design and indicated their financial anxiety. Through moderation-of-process design, the authors examine and showcase that the effect of convenience leads to higher purchase intent for AI-enabled checkouts. Moreover, the authors examine financial anxiety as an underlying mechanism and show that for high-convenience consumers, this enacts higher purchase intent. Findings: The effect of AI-enabled checkouts depends on consumers' convenience perception. High-convenience consumers prefer AI-enabled checkouts over traditional ones, whereas low-convenience consumers are indifferent. Based on the Roy adaptation model theoretical framework, this occurs because high-convenience consumers experience greater financial anxiety when using AI-enabled checkouts, which in turn leads to higher purchase intent. Originality/value: To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to explore the reactions of Saudi Arabian consumers toward cashier-less stores versus traditional stores. Interestingly, their intent to purchase increases, due to the financial anxiety they experience while encountering AI-enabled transactions. Due to the limited research of retailers going cashier less, little is known about consumer reactions and how they may differ culturally. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence (ai); Convenience; Financial Anxiety; Financial Services; Roy Adaptation Model; Saudi Arabia","","","","","Aagja, Jayesh P., Validating service convenience scale and profiling customers: A study in the indian retail context, Vikalpa, 36, 4, pp. 25-49, (2011); Abdulquadri, Abdulazeez Olamide, Digital transformation in financial services provision: a Nigerian perspective to the adoption of chatbot, Journal of Enterprising Communities, 15, 2, pp. 258-281, (2021); Acikgoz, Fulya, The Role of Privacy Cynicism in Consumer Habits with Voice Assistants: A Technology Acceptance Model Perspective, International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 38, 12, pp. 1138-1152, (2022); International Review of Management and Marketing, (2018); Saudi Arabia is the Seventh in the World in the Retail Trade, (2019); Al-Ashban, Aref A., Customer adoption of tele-banking technology: The case of Saudi Arabia, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 19, 5, pp. 191-201, (2001); Do It Yourself Self Checkouts Supermarkets and the Self Service Trend in American Business, (2009); Ashraf, Abdul Rehman, The application of the technology acceptance model under different cultural contexts: The case of online shopping adoption, Journal of International Marketing, 22, 3, pp. 68-93, (2014); Bakpayev, Marat, Programmatic creative: AI can think but it cannot feel, Australasian Marketing Journal, 30, 1, pp. 90-95, (2022); Competition Forum, (2019)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","02652323","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122403012"

Design/methodology/approach: Exploratory, inductive research design. The data was gathered through semi-structured interviews with 47 bank managers in both developed and developing countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Nigeria and Vietnam. Findings: Managers are aware of the prospects of AI and are making efforts to address AI as a business need but find that there often exist certain challenges in accelerating AI adoption. The study also presents a conceptual framework of AI in relation to financial service marketing, which captures and highlights the interactions among the customers, banks and external stakeholders, as well as the regulators. Research limitations/implications: Banks must understand their business objectives, the available resources and the needs of their customers. Managers should keep the ethical implications of their working relationships in mind when selecting a team or collaborating with partners. In addition, managers should be trained and assisted in comprehending AI in relation to financial services, while the regulators must be involved in the development of AI for financial service marketing.

This paper discusses the application of innovative technologies to crisis resolution (ResTech) and sets out its potential scope of application. ResTech is the application of technologies: i) to support the work of resolution authorities in developing resolution plans and in resolving financial firms; and ii) to allow financial firms to achieve regulatory compliance and better risk management in a more effective and automated manner. This paper also argues that the features and market dynamics of resolution differ from those of RegTech and SupTech: there is little market incentive for the private sector to foster innovation in the area of crisis resolution. The lack of private sector incentives to invest in R&D on how to resolve a firm’s crisis leaves the task to resolution authorities.

One of the most problematic areas is the high unpredictability of the result in the field of banking marketing using the most common technique of introducing new services for clients the so called cold calling. Therefore, the question of assessing the proba bility and predicting the behavior of a potential client when promoting new banking services and services using cold calling is particularly relevant. In the course of the study, libraries of machine learning methods and data analysis of the Python programming language were used. A program was developed to build a model for predicting the behavior of bank customers using data processing methods using gradient boosting, regularization of gradient boosting, random forest algorithm and recurrent neural networks. Analogous models were built using cloud machine learning services Azure ML, BigML and the Auto-sklearn library. Data analysis and prediction models built using Python language libraries have a fairly high quality an average of 94.5 %. Using the Azure ML cloud service, a predictive model with an accuracy of 88.6 % was built. The BigML machine learning service made it possible to build a model with an accuracy of 88.8 %. Machine learning methods from the Auto-sklearn library made it possible to obtain a model with a higher quality 94.9 %. This is due to the fact that the proposed libraries of the Python programming language allow better customization of data processing methods and machine learning to obtain more accurate models than free cloud services that do not provide such capabilities. Thanks to this, it is possible to obtain a predictive model of the behavior of bank customers with a fairly high degree of accuracy. It is worth noting that in order to make a prediction (forecast), it is necessary to study the context of the task, process the data, build various machine learning algorithms, evaluate the quality of the models and choose the best of them. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Banking Services; Credit Risk; Credit Scoring; Machine Learning Methods","","","","","Visnyk Universytetu Bankivskoi Spravy Natsionalnoho Banku Ukrainy, (2013); Yak Pratsiuie Bankivskyi Skorynh, (2021); Zvit Pro Finansovu Stabilnist; Pry Azovskyi Economic Herald, (2019); Maja, Mogabe Marcia, Towards a data-driven technology roadmap for the bank of the future: Exploring big data analytics to support technology roadmapping, Social Sciences and Humanities Open, 6, 1, (2022); Sarker, Iqbal H., Data Science and Analytics: An Overview from Data-Driven Smart Computing, Decision-Making and Applications Perspective, SN Computer Science, 2, 5, (2021); Bank Marketing Campaigns Dataset, (2019); Scikit Learn and Rnsorflow 176 Azure Machine Learning, (2019); Bigml Tools; Auto Sklearn","","Technology Center","","","","","","27065448; 26649969","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012903194"

These indicators are based on three broad categories of technical analysis: Price, Volume, and Turnover. Various error metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) have been used to check the performance of the models. Results show that the XGBoost algorithm performs best among the four ensemble models. The mean of absolute error and the root-mean-square -error vary around 3–5%. The feature importance plots generated by the models depict the importance of the variables in predicting the output. The proposed machine learning models help traders, investors, as well as portfolio managers, better predict the stock market trends and, in turn, the returns, particularly in banking stocks minimizing their sole dependency on macroeconomic factors. The techniques further assist the market participants in pre-empting any price-volume action across stocks irrespective of their size, liquidity, or past turnover. Finally, the techniques are incredibly robust and display a strong capability in predicting trend forecasts, particularly with any large deviations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ensemble Techniques; Indian Banks; Machine Learning; Stock Prediction","","","","","Ajmi, Ahdi Noomen, How strong are the causal relationships between Islamic stock markets and conventional financial systems?

Although fraud detection systems have been implemented to detect fraudulent transactions in online banking, many systems just use conventional rule-based approaches. Rule-based detection systems have a difficulty in updating and managing their rules and conditions manually. Additionally, generated from the few fraud cases, the rules are general rather than specific to each user. In this paper, we propose a personalized alarm model to detect frauds in online banking transactions using sequence pattern mining on each user’s normal transaction log. We assumed that a personalized fraud detection model is more effective in responding to the rapid increase in online banking users and diversified fraud patterns. Moreover, we focused on the fact that fraudulent transactions are very different from each user’s usual transactions. Our proposed model divides each user’s log into transactions, extracts a set of sequence patterns, and uses it to determine whether a new incoming transaction is fraudulent. The incoming transaction is divided into multiple windows, and if the normal patterns are not found in the consecutive windows, an alarm is sounded. We applied the model to a real-world dataset and showed that our model outperforms the rule-based model and the Markov chain model. Although more experiments on additional datasets are needed, our personalized alarm model can be applied to real-world systems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fraudulent Transaction Detection; Machine Learning; Online Banking; Sequence Pattern Mining; Markov Chain","Markov chain","","","","Choi, Dahee, An Artificial Intelligence Approach to Financial Fraud Detection under IoT Environment: A Survey and Implementation, Security and Communication Networks, 2018, (2018); International Journal of Scientific Research in Computer Science Engineering and Information Technology, (2018); Wang, Yibo, Leveraging deep learning with LDA-based text analytics to detect automobile insurance fraud, Decision Support Systems, 105, pp. 87-95, (2018); Journal of Society for E Business Studies, (2014); J Korea Inst Inf Secur Cryptol, (2015); Credit Scoring and Credit Control, (2001); Journal of Internet Banking and Commerce, (2019); Quah, Jon Tong Seng, Real-time credit card fraud detection using computational intelligence, Expert Systems with Applications, 35, 4, pp. 1721-1732, (2008); Cai, Saihua, An efficient approach for outlier detection from uncertain data streams based on maximal frequent patterns, Expert Systems with Applications, 160, (2020); Verma, Ayushi, Fraud detection and frequent pattern matching in insurance claims using data mining techniques, 2018-January, pp. 1-7, (2017)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136306448"

This study reports on a comprehensive management survey of district education bureaucrats and their staff that was conducted in every district in Tanzania, and employs flexible machine-learning techniques to identify important management practices associated with learning outcomes. It finds that management practices explain 10 percent of variation in a district's exam performance. The three management practices most predictive of performance are (a) the frequency of school visits, (b) school and teacher incentives administered by the district manager, and (c) performance review of staff. Although the model is not causal, these findings suggest the importance of incentives and active monitoring to motivate district staff, schools, and teachers, that include frequent monitoring of schools. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bureaucrats; Education; Public Management; Tanzania; Bureaucracy; Education; Learning; Local Government; Machine Learning; Management Practice; Performance Assessment; Prediction; Tanzania","bureaucracy; education; learning; local government; machine learning; management practice; performance assessment; prediction; Tanzania","","","","Banerjee, Abhijit V., E-governance, Accountability, and Leakage in Public Programs: Experimental Evidence from a Financial Management Reform in India†, American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 12, 4, pp. 39-72, (2020); Bloom, Nicholas, Does management matter?

However, minutes are by necessity a shortened and edited representation of a broader discussion. Consequently, they may omit information that is predictive of future policy decisions. To investigate this, we compare the predictive content of the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) minutes and transcripts, focusing on dimensions that are likely to be excluded from the minutes, such as the committee's degree of hawkishness, the chairperson's degree of hawkishness, and the level of agreement between committee members. We measure committee and chairperson hawkishness with a new dictionary that is constructed using the FOMC's minutes and transcripts. Agreement is measured using a technique we import from the machine learning literature.

Design/methodology/approach: This research collected the data from 204 millennial customers of Islamic banks in Aceh, Indonesia. Partial least square (PLS) was used to evaluate the effect of service factors (the need for service and service quality), technology-based factors (attitudes towards AI, relative advantage, security and trust) and religiosity on millennial loyalty towards AI-enabled mobile banking. Findings: This inquiry reveals that service quality, attitude towards AI and trust are determinants important for millennial loyalty towards AI-enabled mobile banking. Further, this research notes the significant role of religiosity on millennial loyalty towards mobile banking services. Practical implications: This study suggests Islamic banks focus on developing millennial trust and attitude towards AI to increase their loyalty towards AI-enabled mobile banking services. Further, Islamic banks operation that complies with Islamic law is strongly suggested to develop millennial loyalty.

In this research, we have used multiple classification models for the prediction of DDOS attacks. We have added some complexity to the architecture of generic models to enable them to perform well. We have further applied a support vector machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and random forest algorithms (RF). The SVM shows an accuracy of 99.5%, while KNN and RF scored an accuracy of 97.5% and 98.74%, respectively, for the detection of (DDoS) attacks. Upon comparison, it has been concluded that the SVM is more robust as compared to KNN, RF and existing machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Distributed Denial-of-service; Machine Learning; Support Vector Machine; Machine Learning","machine learning","","","Funding: This research was supported by Future University Researchers Supporting Project Number FUESP-2020/48 at Future University in Egypt, New Cairo 11845, Egypt.

Despite the significant improvement in machine learning (ML) and predictive analysis efficiency for classification in customer relationship management systems (CRM), their performance remains very limited by heterogeneous data processing, class imbalance, and feature scales. This impact turned out to be more important for simple ML methods which in addition often suffer from over-fitting. This paper proposes a succinct and detailed ML model building process including cross-validation of the combination of SMOTE to balance data and ensemble methods for modelling. From the conducted experiments, the random forest (RF) model yielded the best performance of 0.86 in terms of accuracy and f1-scoreusing balanced data. It confirms the literature summary about this topic which shows that RF was among the most effective algorithms for customer predictive classification issues. The constructed and optimized models were interpreted by Shapley values and feature importance analysis which shows that the “age” feature was the most significant while “HasCrCard” was the less one. This process has proven effective in bridging previously reported research gaps and the resulting model should be used for supporting bank customer loyalty decision-making. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank Churn Modelling; Ensemble Methods; Feature Importance; Heterogeneous Data; Imbalance Data; Machine Learning; Shapley Values; Smote","","","","","Ngai, Wai Ting Eric, Application of data mining techniques in customer relationship management: A literature review and classification, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 2 PART 2, pp. 2592-2602, (2009); Femina, Bahari T., An efficient CRM-data mining framework for the prediction of customer behaviour, Procedia Computer Science, 46, pp. 725-731, (2015); Journal of Knowledge Management Practice, (2008); Dick, Alan S., Customer loyalty: Toward an integrated conceptual framework, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 22, 2, pp. 99-113, (1994); International Journal of Computer Applications, (2012); Bhattacharyya, Siddhartha, Data mining for credit card fraud: A comparative study, Decision Support Systems, 50, 3, pp. 602-613, (2011); Garver, Michael Scott, Using data mining for customer satisfaction research, Marketing Research, 14, 1, pp. 8-12, (2002); Int J Intell Syst Appl Eng, (2016); Zhang, Zui, A hybrid fuzzy-based personalized recommender system for telecom products/services, Information Sciences, 235, pp. 117-129, (2013); Díez, Jorge, Optimizing novelty and diversity in recommendations, Progress in Artificial Intelligence, 8, 1, pp. 101-109, (2019)","","MDPI","","","","","","22277390","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134080875"

Customer churn is an issue that any service provider must pay attention to because it is decisive to the development of the business. The competition between banks is getting tougher, hence customer churn prediction has become of great concern to banking service companies. It is necessary for banks to collect colossal data and establish a valued model for classifying types of customers. In this study, three supervised statistical learning methods which are KNN, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting are applied to the churn prediction model using the data source of VIB’s customers. In addition to selecting models belonging to the group of weak single learners such as Neural Networks, Naïve Bayes Classifier, and K-nearest Neighbor..., this paper utilizes Random Forest and Gradient Boosting which are assessed as better models because they can combine weak learners for improving model efficiency and capable of classification. The results exhibited that Gradient Boosting is the best performance in the three above classifiers with a 79.71% of accuracy rate, and 86.23% of ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve graph. Moreover, the decision tree algorithm generates readable rules for churner and non-churner classification which are potentially helpful to managers. Finally, this study suggests a proper model that can be used to forecast churners of mobile banking services in Vietnam. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Customer Churn; Data Mining; Machine Learning; Mobile Banking; Prediction Model","","","","This paper is funded by Research Project coded NTCS2021-30 from Foreign Trade University, Vietnam.","Amin, Adnan, Customer churn prediction in telecommunication industry: With and without counter-example, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 8857, pp. 206-218, (2014); Athanassopoulos, Antreas D., Customer satisfaction cues to support market segmentation and explain switching behavior, Journal of Business Research, 47, 3, pp. 191-207, (2000); Bardab, Saeed Ngmaldin, Data mining classification algorithms: An overview, International Journal of Advanced and Applied Sciences, 8, 2, pp. 1-5, (2021); Bhattacharya, Chitrabhanu B., When customers are members: Customer retention in paid membership contexts, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 26, 1, pp. 31-44, (1998); Colgate, Mark R., Customer defection: A study of the student market in Ireland, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 14, 3, pp. 23-29, (1996); Colgate, Mark R., Implementing a customer relationship strategy: The asymmetric impact of poor versus excellent execution, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 28, 3, pp. 375-387, (2000); Dahiya, Kiran, Customer churn analysis in telecom industry, (2015); Forhad, Navid, Churn analysis: Predicting churners, pp. 237-241, (2014); Ganesh, Jaishankar, Understanding the customer base of service providers: An examination of the differences between switchers and stayers, Journal of Marketing, 64, 3, pp. 65-87, (2000); An Introduction to Statistical Learning, (2013)","","Institute of Advanced Science Extension (IASE)","","","","","","2313626X; 23133724","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133570374"

Our main contribution is in exploring this rich dataset, which contains prior client behavior traits that enable us to document new insights into the main determinants predicting future client churn. We conduct a horserace of many supervised machine learning algorithms under the same cross-validation and evaluation setup, enabling a fair comparison across algorithms. We find that the random forests technique outperforms decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, elastic net, logistic regression, and support vector machines models in several metrics. Our investigation reveals that customers with a stronger relationship with the institution, who have more products and services, who borrow more from the bank, are less likely to close their checking accounts. Using a back-of-the-envelope estimation, we find that our model has the potential to forecast potential losses of up to 10% of the operating result reported by the largest Brazilian banks in 2019, suggesting the model has a significant economic impact. Our results corroborate the importance of investing in cross-selling and upselling strategies focused on their current customers. These strategies can have positive side effects on customer retention. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Churn; Churn Prediction; Financial Services; Machine Learning; Random Forests; Decision Trees; Forecasting; Large Dataset; Logistic Regression; Nearest Neighbor Search; Random Forests; Support Vector Machines; Banking Sectors; Churn; Churn Predictions; Client Behaviour; Customer Churns; Customer Level; Financial Institution; Financial Service; Machine Learning Approaches; Supervised Machine Learning; Sales","Decision trees; Forecasting; Large dataset; Logistic regression; Nearest neighbor search; Random forests; Support vector machines; Banking sectors; Churn; Churn predictions; Client behaviour; Customer churns; Customer level; Financial institution; Financial service; Machine learning approaches; Supervised machine learning; Sales","","","Thiago C.

Recently, business organizations are moving toward an automated information-driven decision-making process. This study facilitates the development of a decision-making system that will gather knowledge from customer databases and segregate the customers who are likely to leave the organization. A hybrid machine learning model has been proposed in this study that will boost predictive performance. Two sets of machine learning-based models, namely; single learners and ensemble learners, are applied to the customer retention database. The models are implemented by adjusting underlying parameters to infer the best predictive performance. Finally, the best model from each category is picked up and assembled to construct the hybrid model. From single learner and ensemble-based models, SVM and Adaboost turn out to be promising models, respectively. Hence, the SVM and Adaboost models are unified under a single platform, which significantly outperforms other pre-existing models.

The search for the optimal model is still a challenge that researchers seek to address. Despite advances in current work that surpass the limitations of previous ones, research still faces new challenges in every field. For the automatic targeting of customers in a banking telemarketing campaign, the use of ML-based approaches in previous work has not been able to show transparency in the processing of heterogeneous data, achieve optimal performance or use minimal resources. In this paper, we introduce a class membership-based (CMB) classifier which is a transparent approach well adapted to heterogeneous data that exploits nominal variables in the decision function. These dummy variables are often either suppressed or coded in an arbitrary way in most works without really evaluating their impact on the final performance of the models. In many cases, their coding either favours or disfavours the learning model performance without necessarily reflecting reality, which leads to over-fitting or decreased performance. In this work, we applied the CMB approach to data from a bank telemarketing campaign to build an optimal model for predicting potential customers before launching a campaign. The results obtained suggest that the CMB approach can predict the success of future prospecting more accurately than previous work. Furthermore, in addition to its better performance in terms of accuracy (97.3%), the model also gives a very close score for the AUC (95.9%), showing its stability, which would be very unfavourable to over-fitting. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Bank Telemarketing; Data Mining; Heterogeneous Data; Machine Learning; Performance Optimisation; Predictive Modelling; Targeted Marketing","","","","","Al-Garadi, Mohammed Ali, A Survey of Machine and Deep Learning Methods for Internet of Things (IoT) Security, IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 22, 3, pp. 1646-1685, (2020); Amini, Mohammad Matin, A Cluster-Based Data Balancing Ensemble Classifier for Response Modeling in Bank Direct Marketing, International Journal of Computational Intelligence and Applications, 14, 4, (2015); Ballings, Michel, CRM in social media: Predicting increases in Facebook usage frequency, European Journal of Operational Research, 244, 1, pp. 248-260, (2015); Bhattacharyya, Siddhartha, Data mining for credit card fraud: A comparative study, Decision Support Systems, 50, 3, pp. 602-613, (2011); Data Mining Methods Applications and Systems, (2020); Butcher, David, Security challenge and defense in VoIP infrastructures, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics Part C: Applications and Reviews, 37, 6, pp. 1152-1162, (2007); Chawla, Nitesh Vinay, SMOTE: Synthetic minority over-sampling technique, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 16, pp. 321-357, (2002); Chen, Sheng, RAMOBoost: Ranked minority oversampling in boosting, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 21, 10, pp. 1624-1642, (2010); Cherif, Walid, Optimization of K-NN algorithm by clustering and reliability coefficients: Application to breast-cancer diagnosis, Procedia Computer Science, 127, pp. 293-299, (2018); Marius, Cioca, Machine learning and creative methods used to classify customers in a CRM systems, Applied Mechanics and Materials, 371, pp. 769-773, (2013)","","MDPI","","","","","","19118074","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132549942"

A multinomial modeling approach is applied to panel data in order to track and capture end-to-end cyclical crisis formations, which enhances the binary focus of previous research studies. Several macroeconomic and banking sector variables are shown to be emblematic of leading indicators across the idiosyncratic stages of a banking crisis. Gross domestic product is an early warning signal across all phases, and a concomitant deterioration in consumption spending and fixed capital formation, preceded by a credit boom, signal a banking crisis to come. Currency depreciation exemplifies ensuing financial distress, reinforced by developmental constructs and regional integration. Lower real interest rates, increasing imports, and rising deposits are frequently harbingers of a recovery. Period effects underscore the dynamic evolution of common contemporaneous precursors over time. Premised on pursuing cyclical movements through multiple outcomes, our findings on forecasting performance suggest enhanced predictive power. Several multinomial logistic models generate higher predictive accuracy in contrast to probit models. Compared to machine learning methods (which encompass artificial neural networks, gradient boost, k-nearest neighbors, and random forests methods), a multinomial logistic approach outperforms during pre-crisis periods and when crisis severity is modeled, whereas gradient boost has the highest predictive accuracy across numerous versions of the multinomial model. As investors and policy makers continue to confront banking crises, leading to high economic and social costs, enhanced multinomial modeling methods make a valuable contribution to improved forecasting performance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking Crises; Early Warning Signal; Forecasting; Leading Indicators; Machine Learning; Multinomial Modeling; Panel Data","","","","I thank the editor, three anonymous referees, Ulrich Fritsche (for guidance), and conference participants at the 2021 International Conference on Economic Modeling and Data Science held by the Center for European Studies and the Department of Economics, Management and Statistics of the University of Milano-Bicocca, and the 2020 Conference on International Economics held by the Spanish Association of International Economics and Finance and the Faculty of Social and Legal Sciences of University of Castilla-La Mancha for valuable suggestions and comments.","Early Warning Systems A Survey and A Regime Switching Approach, (2003); Akerlof, George A., Animal spirits: How human psychology drives the economy, and why it matters for global capitalism, pp. 1-230, (2010); Allen, Franklin, Optimal financial crises, Journal of Finance, 53, 4, pp. 1245-1284, (1998); Allen, Franklin, Financial contagion, Journal of Political Economy, 108, 1, pp. 1-33, (2000); Alessi, Lucia, Identifying excessive credit growth and leverage, Journal of Financial Stability, 35, pp. 215-225, (2018); undefined; Banking and Business in the Roman World, (1999); African Trade Statistics Yearbook 2017, (2017); Baron, Matthew, Banking Crises without Panics, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 136, 1, pp. 51-113, (2021); Berg, Andrew G., Assessing early warning systems: How have they worked in practice?, IMF Staff Papers, 52, 3, pp. 462-502, (2005)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09393625","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131344099"

Second, we observe that modified ensemble bagging models show improved classification model performance on balanced datasets, as they can adjust behavior and make them more suitable for relatively small datasets.

As part of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP), the European Central Bank (ECB) has determined this assessment should take into consideration both the institution's ability to meet its short-term obligations and its long-term funding strategy. Due to the fast pace of financial markets and more demanding regulations, there is a structural need for a precise and widely accepted risk assessment methodology. Furthermore, the ability to foresee alternative scenarios by stressing the involved key risk indicators is of the utmost importance. This work investigates whether machine learning techniques can successfully model liquidity risk, thus providing insights for stress-testing scenarios. We have applied the Risk Assessment System (RAS) methodology to classify credit institutions from the Portuguese banking sector according to their liquidity risk, using real supervisory data (from 2014 until March 2021). We then studied the ability to model this risk classification, by comparing a series of well-established machine learning algorithms to a traditional statistical model for benchmarking. The results show that extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) outperforms other methods for this classification problem. The resulting model can be set up for a production environment and provide scenarios for stress-testing, or as an early warning system (EWS), thus supporting the overall SREP exercise. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking Supervision; Ecb Risk Assessment System; Ews; Liquidity; Machine Learning; Risk Assessment; Scenario Analysis","","","","The views, thoughts, and opinions expressed in the text belong solely to the authors.","Abellán, Joaquín, A comparative study on base classifiers in ensemble methods for credit scoring, Expert Systems with Applications, 73, pp. 1-10, (2017); Classification Clustering and Data Mining Applications, (2004); Encyclopedia of Biometrics, (2009); Altman, Edward I., FINANCIAL RATIOS, DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS AND THE PREDICTION OF CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY, Journal of Finance, 23, 4, pp. 589-609, (1968); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Fsi Insights Policy Implement, (2018); Machine Learning at Central Banks, (2017); Chen, Tianqi, XGBoost: A scalable tree boosting system, 13-17-August-2016, pp. 785-794, (2016); Climent, Francisco J., Anticipating bank distress in the Eurozone: An Extreme Gradient Boosting approach, Journal of Business Research, 101, pp. 885-896, (2019); Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B, (1958)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","22042296","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124838098"

Here, an unsupervised machine learning approach, Self Organizing Maps (SOM), is applied to discover links between surface current variability and phytoplankton productivity during seasonal upwelling over the Agulhas Bank (South Africa), from 23 years (November-March 1997-2020) of daily satellite observations (surface current, sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a). The SOM patterns extracted over this dynamically complex region, which is dominated by the Agulhas Current (AC), revealed 4 topologies/modes of the AC system. An AC flowing southwestward along the shelf edge is the dominant mode. An AC with a cyclonic meander near shelf is the second most frequent mode. An AC with a cyclonic meander off shelf and AC early retroflection modes are the least frequent. These AC topologies influence the circulation and the phytoplankton productivity on the shelf. Strong (weak) seasonal upwelling is seen in the AC early retroflection, the AC with a cyclonic meander near shelf modes and in part of the AC along the shelf edge mode (the AC with a cyclonic meander off shelf mode and in part the AC along the shelf edge mode). The more productive patterns are generally associated with a strong southwestward flow over the central bank caused by the AC intrusion to the east Bank or via an anticyclonic meander. The less productive situations can be related to a weaker southwest flow over the central bank, strong northeast flow on the eastern bank, and/or to a stronger northwest flow on the central bank. The SOM patterns show marked year-to-year variability. The high/low productivity events seem to be linked to the occurrence of extreme phases in climate variability modes (El Niño Southern Oscillation, Indian Ocean Dipole). © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agulhas Bank; Agulhas Current; Cold Ridge Upwelling; Machine Learning; Phytoplankton Productivity; Satellite Observations; Self-organizing Maps","","","","Funding text 1: We the thank the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) (https://marine.copernicus.eu/) for distributing the satellite SST, Chl-a and the altimetry-derived absolute geostrophic currents.; Funding text 2: The study was supported by the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) under NERC grant NE/P021050/1 in the framework of the SOLSTICE-WIO project ( https://www.solstice-wio.org/ ).","Ardyna, Mathieu, Delineating environmental control of phytoplankton biomass and phenology in the Southern Ocean, Geophysical Research Letters, 44, 10, pp. 5016-5024, (2017); Arnault, Sabine, A tropical Atlantic dynamics analysis by combining machine learning and satellite data, Advances in Space Research, 68, 2, pp. 467-486, (2021); Augustyn, Johann, South Africa, 2-2, pp. 479-522, (2017); Backeberg, B., Impact of intensified Indian Ocean winds on mesoscale variability in the Agulhas system, Nature Climate Change, 2, 8, pp. 608-612, (2012); Badran, Fouad, Self-organizing maps and unsupervised classification, pp. 379-442, (2005); Beal, Lisa M., On the role of the Agulhas system in ocean circulation and climate, Nature, 472, 7344, pp. 429-436, (2011); Behrenfeld, Michael J., Climate-driven trends in contemporary ocean productivity, Nature, 444, 7120, pp. 752-755, (2006); Blanke, Bruno, Ocean variability over the Agulhas Bank and its dynamical connection with the southern Benguela upwelling system, Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, 114, 12, (2009); Boening, Carmen, The 2011 la Nia: So strong, the oceans fell, Geophysical Research Letters, 39, 19, (2012); Boukabara, Sid Ahmed, Outlook for exploiting artificial intelligence in the Earth and environmental sciences, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 102, 5, pp. E1016-E1023, (2021)","","Frontiers Media S.A.","","","","","","22967745","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130630813"

The m-banking system allows users to pay for goods, services, and earn money via cryptotrading using any device such as mobile phones from anywhere. With the recent trends in global digital markets, especially the cryptocurrency market, m-banking is projected to have a brighter future. However, information stored or conveyed via these channels is more vulnerable to different security threats. Thus, the aim of this study is to examine the influence of security and confidentiality on m-banking patronage using artificial intelligence ensemble methods (ANFIS, GPR, EANN, and BRT) for the prediction of safety and secrecy effects. AI models were trained and tested using 745 datasets obtained from the study areas. The results indicated that AI models predicted the influence of security with high precision (NSE > 0.95), with the GPR model outperformed the other models. The results indicated that security and privacy were key influential parameters of m-payment system patronage (m-banking), followed by service and interface quali-ties. Unlike previous m-banking studies, the study results showed ease of use and culture to have no influence on m-banking patronage. These study results would assist m-payment system stake-holders, while the approach may serve as motivation for researchers to use AI techniques. The study also provides directions for future m-banking studies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Ensemble Techniques; M-banking; Machine Learning; Privacy; Security; Artificial Intelligence; Artificial Neural Network; Banking; Gaussian Method; Ground Penetrating Radar; Machine Learning; Numerical Method; Prediction; Regression Analysis; Safety; Security","artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; banking; Gaussian method; ground penetrating radar; machine learning; numerical method; prediction; regression analysis; safety; security","","","Funding: The study is funded by the authors.","Kim, Changsu, An empirical examination of factors influencing the intention to use mobile payment, Computers in Human Behavior, 26, 3, pp. 310-322, (2010); Park, Jungkun, M-payment service: Interplay of perceived risk, benefit, and trust in service adoption, Human Factors and Ergonomics in Manufacturing and Service Industries, 29, 1, pp. 31-43, (2019); Cavus, Nadire, An artificial intelligence‐based model for prediction of parameters affecting sustainable growth of mobile banking apps, Sustainability (Switzerland), 13, 11, (2021); Lu, Zhou, The impact of geopolitical risks on financial development: Evidence from emerging markets, Journal of Competitiveness, 12, 1, pp. 93-107, (2020); Moghavvemi, Sedigheh, Drivers and barriers of mobile payment adoption: Malaysian merchants' perspective, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 59, (2021); Lee, Seo-joon, Design, development and implementation of a smartphone overdependence management system for the self-control of smart devices, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 6, 12, (2016); Nguyen, Oanh Thi Kim, Factors affecting the intention to use digital banking in Vietnam, Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business, 7, 3, pp. 303-310, (2020); Fernandes Malaquias, Rodrigo, An empirical study on trust in mobile banking: A developing country perspective, Computers in Human Behavior, 54, pp. 453-461, (2016); Kaur, Simran Jit, Adoption of digital banking channels in an emerging economy: exploring the role of in-branch efforts, Journal of Financial Services Marketing, 26, 2, pp. 107-121, (2021); Alkhowaiter, Wassan Abdullah, Digital payment and banking adoption research in Gulf countries: A systematic literature review, International Journal of Information Management, 53, (2020)","","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130575545"

We compare these models to the traditional model usually in place that basically relies on a combination of logistic regression and expert judgement. The comparison is made along two sets of criterias capturing: the ability to pass compliance tests used by the regulators during on-site missions of model validation (i), and the induced changes in capital requirement (ii). The different models show noticeable differences in their ability to pass the regulatory tests and to lead to a reduction in capital requirement. While displaying a similar ability than the traditional model to pass compliance tests, neural networks provide the strongest incentive for banks to apply AI models for their internal model of credit risk of corporate businesses as they lead in some cases to sizeable reduction in capital requirement. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Credit Risk; Regulatory Requirement","","","","","undefined, (2020); undefined, (2019); Khandani, Amir Ehsan, Consumer credit-risk models via machine-learning algorithms, Journal of Banking and Finance, 34, 11, pp. 2767-2787, (2010); Baesens, Bart M.M., Benchmarking state-of-the-art classification algorithms for credit scoring, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 54, 6, pp. 627-635, (2003); Barboza, Flavio Luiz De Moraes, Machine learning models and bankruptcy prediction, Expert Systems with Applications, 83, pp. 405-417, (2017); undefined, (2014); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); undefined; Friedman, Jerome H., Greedy function approximation: A gradient boosting machine, Annals of Statistics, 29, 5, pp. 1189-1232, (2001); Aistats, (2010)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","03784266","","JBFID","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123614970"

While traditional banks have adopted artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to deepen the development of mobile banking applications (apps), the current literature lacks research on the use of AI-based constructs to explore users' mobile banking app adoption intentions. To fill this gap, based on stimulus-organism-response (SOR) theory, two AI feature constructs as stimuli are considered, namely, perceived intelligence and anthropomorphism. This study then develops a research model to investigate how intelligence and anthropomorphism affect task-technology fit (TTF), perceived cost, perceived risk and trust (organism), which in turn influence users' AI mobile banking app adoption (response). Design/methodology/approach: This study used a convenience nonprobability sampling approach; a total of 451 responses were collected to examine the model. The partial least squares technique was utilized for data analysis. Findings: The results show that intelligence and anthropomorphism increase users' willingness to adopt mobile banking apps through TTF and trust. However, higher levels of anthropomorphism enhance users' perceived cost. In addition, both intelligence and anthropomorphism have insignificant effects on perceived risk. The results provide theoretical contributions for AI-based mobile banking app adoption and offer practical guidance for bank planning to use AI to retain users. Originality/value: Based on SOR theory, this study reveals that as features, AI-enabled intelligence and anthropomorphism help us further understand users' perceptions regarding cost, risk, TTF and trust in the context of AI-enabled app adoption intentions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adoption Intention; Artificial Intelligence; Mobile Banking; Perceived Anthropomorphism; Perceived Intelligence; Stimulus-organism-response (sor) Theory","","","","The authors thank the editors and reviewers for their useful comments and suggestions, which helped us enhance the quality of this manuscript.","Afshan, Sahar, Acceptance of mobile banking framework in Pakistan, Telematics and Informatics, 33, 2, pp. 370-387, (2016); Agyei, James, Mobile Banking Adoption: Examining the Role of Personality Traits, SAGE Open, 10, 2, (2020); George, Ajimon, Perceptions of Internet banking users — a structural equation modelling (SEM) approach, IIMB Management Review, 30, 4, pp. 357-368, (2018); Al-Debei, Mutaz M., Consumer attitudes towards online shopping: The effects of trust, perceived benefits, and perceived web quality, Internet Research, 25, 5, pp. 707-733, (2015); Al-Emran, Mostafa, Investigating attitudes towards the use of mobile learning in higher education, Computers in Human Behavior, 56, pp. 93-102, (2016); Strategic Leadership for Business Value Creation, (2021); Journal of Marketing Research, (1977); Journal of Marketing Research, (1982); Ashraf, Abdul Rehman, Perceived values and motivations influencing m-commerce use: A nine-country comparative study, International Journal of Information Management, 59, (2021); Baabdullah, Abdullah Mohammed A., An integrated model for m-banking adoption in Saudi Arabia, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 37, 2, pp. 452-478, (2019)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","02652323","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123478794"

Information on seed persistence in soil is of great importance for fundamental and applied research, yet compiling data sets on this trait still requires enormous efforts. We asked whether the machine-learning (ML) approach could be used to infer and predict SSB properties of a regional flora based on easily available data. Location: Eighteen calcareous grasslands located along an elevational gradient of almost 2000 m in the Bavarian Alps, Germany. Methods: We compared a commonly used ML model (random forest) with a conventional model (linear regression model) as to their ability to predict SSB presence/absence and density using empirical data on SSB characteristics (environmental, seed traits and phylogenetic predictors). Further, we identified the most important determinants of seed persistence in soil for predicting qualitative and quantitative SSB characteristics using the ML approach. Results: We demonstrated that the ML model predicts SSB characteristics significantly better than the linear regression model. A single set of predictors (either environment, or seed traits, or phylogenetic eigenvectors) was sufficient for the ML model to achieve high performance in predicting SSB characteristics. Importantly, we established that a few widely available SSB predictors can achieve high predictive power in the ML approach, suggesting a high flexibility of the developed approach for use in various study systems. Conclusions: Our study provides a novel methodological approach that combines empirical knowledge on the determinants of SSB characteristics with a modern, flexible statistical approach based on ML. It clearly demonstrates that ML can be developed into a key tool to facilitate labor-intensive, costly and time-consuming functional trait research. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Persistence; Predictive Modeling; Random Forest; Seed; Soil; Trait","","","","","Abedi, Mehdi, Effects of substrate type, moisture and its interactions on soil seed survival of three Rumex species, Plant and Soil, 374, 1-2, pp. 485-495, (2014); Anderson, Todd Michael, Seed germination cues and the importance of the soil seed bank across an environmental gradient in the Serengeti, Oikos, 121, 2, pp. 306-312, (2012); Apley, Daniel W., Visualizing the effects of predictor variables in black box supervised learning models, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

Significant variables that negatively influence consumer perceived ethicality include gender, education, use of financial advisory services, banks' manipulation of information about financial products and use of personal data against the will of customers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Banking Ethics; Digital Technologies; Electronic Banking; Ethical Judgement; Financial Advisory Services","","","","","Al-Salim, Majda I.Ayoub, A closer look at the relationship of entry-level bank employees’ leadership attributes and customer satisfaction, Journal of Financial Services Marketing, 23, 2, pp. 91-103, (2018); Ardichvili, Alexandre A., Characteristics of ethical business cultures, Journal of Business Ethics, 85, 4, pp. 445-451, (2009); Barredo-Arrieta, Alejandro, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): Concepts, taxonomies, opportunities and challenges toward responsible AI, Information Fusion, 58, pp. 82-115, (2020); Arthur, Keren Naa Abeka, A Micro-ethnographic Study of Big Data-Based Innovation in the Financial Services Sector: Governance, Ethics and Organisational Practices, Journal of Business Ethics, 160, 2, pp. 363-375, (2019); Polska Bankowosc W Liczbach 2015, (2016); Polska Bankowosc W Liczbach IV Kwartal, (2021); International Journal of Economic Perspectives, (2017); Brunk, Katja H., Exploring origins of ethical company/brand perceptions - A consumer perspective of corporate ethics, Journal of Business Research, 63, 3, pp. 255-262, (2010); Brunk, Katja H., One strike and you're out: Qualitative insights into the formation of consumers' ethical company or brand perceptions, Journal of Business Research, 64, 2, pp. 134-141, (2011); Brunk, Katja H., How do Consumers Reconcile Positive and Negative CSR-Related Information to Form an Ethical Brand Perception?

We can utilize this ability of machines in various fields or applications. One specific field of interest is a prediction of churning customers in any industry. Prediction of churning customers is the state of art approach which predicts which customer is near to leave the services of the specific bank. We can use this approach in any big organization that is very conscious about their customers. However, this study aims to develop a model that offers a meaningful churn prediction for the banking industry. For this purpose, we develop a customer churn prediction approach with the three intelligent models random forest (RF), AdaBoost, and support vector machine (SVM). This approach achieves the best result when the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is applied to overcome the unbalanced dataset and the combination of undersampling and oversampling. The method on SMOTED data has produced excellent results with a 91.90 F1 score and overall accuracy of 88.7% using RF. Furthermore, the experimental results show that RF yielded good results for the full feature-selected datasets. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaboost; Banking Industry; Churning; Random Forest; Smote; Support Vector Machine","","","","","Japparova, Irina, Banking business models of the digital future: The case of Latvia, European Research Studies Journal, 20, 3, pp. 864-878, (2017); Nie, Guangli, Credit card churn forecasting by logistic regression and decision tree, Expert Systems with Applications, 38, 12, pp. 15273-15285, (2011); Goel, Richa, Moving from cash to cashless economy: - A study of consumer perception towards digital transactions, International Journal of Recent Technology and Engineering, 8, 1, pp. 1220-1226, (2019); Rajamohamed, R., Improved credit card churn prediction based on rough clustering and supervised learning techniques, Cluster Computing, 21, 1, pp. 65-77, (2018); Bursztyn, Leonardo, Status Goods: Experimental evidence from platinum credit cards, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 133, 3, pp. 1561-1595, (2018); Advances in Machine Learning and Computational Intelligence, (2021); Sundarkumar, G.

With the increasing adoption of machine learning to enhance decision-support systems, and the amount of collected data spiking, institutions provide countless use-cases for the application of these innovative technologies. Consequently, in recent years, the term sup-tech has entered the financial jargon and is here to stay. In this paper, we address risk assessment from a central bank’s perspective. The uptrending number of involved banks and institutions raises the necessity of a standardised risk methodology. For that reason, we adopted the Risk Assessment Methodology (RAS), the quantitative pillar from the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP). Based on real-world supervisory data from the Portuguese banking sector, from March 2014 until August 2021, we successfully model the supervisory risk assessment process, in its quantitative approach by the RAS. Our findings and the resulting model are proposed as an Early Warning System that can support supervisors in their day-to-day tasks, as well as within the SREP process. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking Supervision; Ecb Risk Assessment System; Ews; Machine Learning; Risk Assessment; Scenario Analysis; Sup-tech","","","","","Abellán, Joaquín, A comparative study on base classifiers in ensemble methods for credit scoring, Expert Systems with Applications, 73, pp. 1-10, (2017); Classification Clustering and Data Mining Applications, (2004); Machine Learning in Credit Risk Measuring the Dilemma Between Prediction and Supervisory Cost, (2020); Altman, Edward I., FINANCIAL RATIOS, DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS AND THE PREDICTION OF CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY, Journal of Finance, 23, 4, pp. 589-609, (1968); Antunes, José Américo Pereira, To supervise or to self-supervise: a machine learning based comparison on credit supervision, Financial Innovation, 7, 1, (2021); Fsi Insights on Policy Implementation, (2021); Fsi Insights Policy Implement, (2018); An Early Warning System for Banking Crises from Regression Based Analysis to Machine Learning Techniques, (2019); Cawley, Gavin C., On over-fitting in model selection and subsequent selection bias in performance evaluation, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 11, pp. 2079-2107, (2010); Machine Learning at Central Banks, (2017)","","MDPI","","","","","","22279091","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127758467"

However, due to this sector's inherent nature, data security cannot be jeopardized. Users must place great trust in their bank branches—a necessary feature of relationships between banking institutions and their clients. Banks’ reputation also directly affects their success, ability to attract new customers, and retention of existing ones. These issues mean that making decisions regarding how to deal with the challenges of incorporating artificial intelligence (AI), digital transformation and cybersecurity into the banking sector is quite complex.

Another high technology is implemented to obtain a very fast decision-making process for each loan request is powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. This technology is built on top of machine learning where loan requests can be determined just less than 10 minutes. The same service is mostly performed manually by a bank, where at this point there are a lot of manual processes that should be handled by a human.

The author tried to respond to the following problematics: Would AI be able to replace man power in customer service? and would AI change the job of the banker and render the bank more profitable? Design/methodology/approach: The data collected and analyzed was used in a quantitative research-based models with the application of hypothesis regression models. The results obtained has helped despite the fact of its innovative framework, AI cannot replace the role of humans when it comes to client’s interactions with banks employees. Findings: AI elevates the quality of banking transactions to an upper edge. Some of the technical banking jobs might be in jeopardy with AI, as the technology can be easily replaced with human resources, but when emotional intelligence is required for banks clients/employee’s relationship management, AI has been found with no ability to supersede. Research limitations/implications: Researchers in the future can also compare large banks called alpha banks to smaller banks in the same developing country to further test the possibility of adopting innovation and change through AI in different sizes of banks with larger number of employees, financial resources and corporate clients. Practical implications: Fears regarding impact on employment were detected, AI could render many banks’ jobs obsolete in the coming years, asserting that AI and robotics “reduce the need for staff in roles such as back office functions. Data suggests that the proliferation of AI could be accompanied by a rise in banking jobs. It may also be the case that only the most mundane jobs such as data entry will be sacrificed for machine superiority. While a rise in job numbers associated with higher AI-adoption rates seems ideal, some evidence suggests that most financial institutions are not yet fully confident in how to effectively apply the technology for the best results but at the same time seemed to be receptive to using AI and machine learning in their organization. Social implications: This study was conducted and limited to one developing Asian country, it would be useful to stretch this study covering other countries in the region to dive into more diversified results that could trigger researchers to compare more the adoption of AI in Asian countries and evaluating its impact with respect to different countries size and/or level of development in addition to other demographics and criteria. Originality/value: Financial institutions are increasingly using artificial neural network systems to detect fraud and charges that do not meet the standard. The AI is used to: organize transactions; keep accounts; invest in stocks; optimize portfolios, etc. Reducing the number of frauds and financial crimes in Lebanon by monitoring user behavior to detect abnormal changes or anomalies in addition to the possible rectification of human economic behavior in the Asian region, this could add a great value and high originality to the research. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Consumer Behavior; Employability","","","","","Akter, Shahriar, Reshaping competitive advantages with analytics capabilities in service systems, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 159, (2020); Self Efficacy in Changing Societies, (1995); Fintech is Disrupting the Banking Industry and Banks Must React to the Rapid Emergence of these New Market Players, (2018); Berntson, Erik, Investigating the relationship between employability and self-e.cacy: A cross-lagged analysis, European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology, 17, 4, pp. 413-425, (2008); L Intelligence Artificielle Investit Le Secteur Bancaire, (2017); Advertising Age, (1952); Dacre-Pool, Lorraine, The key to employability: Developing a practical model of graduate employability, Education and Training, 49, 4, pp. 277-289, (2007); Higher Education in the Learning Society, (1997); De-Arteaga, Maria, Machine learning for the developing world, ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems, 9, 2, (2018); Moral Dimension Toward A New Economics, (1988)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","15592243; 15587894","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108305889"

Financial institutions use ML for building risk scorecards that support a range of credit-related decisions. Yet, the literature on fair ML in credit scoring is scarce. The paper makes three contributions. First, we revisit statistical fairness criteria and examine their adequacy for credit scoring. Second, we catalog algorithmic options for incorporating fairness goals in the ML model development pipeline. Last, we empirically compare different fairness processors in a profit-oriented credit scoring context using real-world data. The empirical results substantiate the evaluation of fairness measures, identify suitable options to implement fair credit scoring, and clarify the profit-fairness trade-off in lending decisions. We find that multiple fairness criteria can be approximately satisfied at once and recommend separation as a proper criterion for measuring the fairness of a scorecard. We also find fair in-processors to deliver a good balance between profit and fairness and show that algorithmic discrimination can be reduced to a reasonable level at a relatively low cost.

To this end, this paper unifies a dynamic quantification framework for systemic risk and links it to a two-step supervised learning problem, which allows for hierarchical structure of the systemic event and the return dependence. We leverage the generalization and predictive powers of machine learning to statistically model the tail events and the co-movements of the equity returns during the shocks to the macro-economy. Our results show that most machine learning algorithms enhance the systemic risk measure's predictive power.

This study tests whether advanced data processing techniques are capable of classifying Euribor panel banks as either manipulating or non-manipulating on the basis of patterns found in quotes submissions. For this purpose, panel banks’ daily contributions have been studied and monthly variables obtained that denote different contribution patterns for Euribor panel banks. Thus, in accordance with the court verdict, banks are categorized as manipulating and non-manipulating and Machine Learning classification techniques such as Supervised Learning, Anomaly Detection and Cluster Analysis are applied in order to discriminate between convicted and acquitted banks. The results show that out of seven manipulative banks, five are detected by Machine Learning using Deep Learning algorithms, all five presenting very similar contribution patterns. This is consistent with Anomaly Detection which confirms that several manipulating banks present similar levels of abnormality in their contributions. In addition, the Cluster Analysis facilitates gathering the five most active banks in illicit actions. In conclusion, administrators and supervisors might find these techniques useful to detect potentially illicit actions by banks involved in the Euribor rate-setting process. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classification; Collusion; Euribor; Machine Learning; Manipulation; Panel Bank; Rate-fixing; Anomaly Detection; Cluster Analysis; Learning Algorithms; Advanced Data Processing; Classification Technique; Collusion; Euro Interbank Offered Rate; International Financial Markets; Machine Learning Classification; Manipulation; Panel Bank; Rate-fixing; Deep Learning; Banking; Classification; Cluster Analysis; Data Processing; Financial Market; Machine Learning; Europe","Anomaly detection; Cluster analysis; Learning algorithms; Advanced data processing; Classification technique; Collusion; Euro interbank offered rate; International financial markets; Machine learning classification; Manipulation; Panel bank; Rate-fixing; Deep learning; banking; classification; cluster analysis; data processing; financial market; machine learning; Europe","","","Grant PGC2018-093645-B-I00 funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and by “ERDF A way of making Europe""","Ben Jabeur, Sami, CatBoost model and artificial intelligence techniques for corporate failure prediction, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 166, (2021); Collusive Benchmark Rates Fixing, (2022); Libor Scandal What S Next A Possible Way Forward Retrieved June 17 2019 from Vox Cepr Policy Portal Columns by Date 2013 View all 47 Columns, (2013); Carmona Ibáñez, Pedro, Predicting failure in the U.S. banking sector: An extreme gradient boosting approach, International Review of Economics and Finance, 61, pp. 304-323, (2019); Duffie, J.

Recently, social schemes have seen significant expansion across many developing countries including India. The fundamental aims of social schemes are to alleviate poverty, enhance the quality of life of the most vulnerable and offer greater chances to those relegated to the fringe of society to engage more enthusiastically in the society. Although governments channel billions of dollars every year in support of these social schemes, quite significant number of the eligible people are excluded from the program mainly through fraud and dishonesty. Although fraud is considered an illegal offence and morally reprehensible, it is unfortunate that the prevalence of fraud in social benefit schemes is rampant and a significant challenge to address. In this paper, we studied the viability of machine learning techniques in identifying fraudulent transactions in the context of social schemes. We focus on the detection of the false income level claims made by the fake beneficiaries to get the privileges of government scheme. We used the standard classifiers like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron and Naïve Bayes to identify fake beneficiaries of the government scheme from those deserving people. The results show that the Random Forest Classifier perform best providing an accuracy of 99.3% with F1 score of 0.99. The outcome of this research can be used by the government agencies entrusted with the management of the schemes to wade out the abusers and provide the required benefits to the right and deserving recipients. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking; Classification; Fraud Detection; Machine Learning; Social Scheme","","","","Dr. Anil Kumar K.M is currently working as Associate Professor, Department of Computer Science & Engineering, JSS Science and Technology University, Mysuru, Karnataka, India.

Traditional econometric models with their implicit assumption of linear as well as time-invariant relationship between the target variable and explanatory variables have been questioned for long, resulting in the emergence of alternative models and techniques to better capture the changing inflation dynamics. This paper uses machine learning (ML) based forecasting techniques to capture the possible non-linear relationships between inflation and its determinants and compare their forecasting performance with some of the popular traditional time series models for both the pre-COVID and post-COVID periods.

By considering the effects of learning algorithms on the employees’ work experience from their perspective, we provide a novel application of job crafting theory. Employees’ concerted response across the three job crafting dimensions underlines the importance of synergy across job crafting dimensions if they are to be successful in altering employees’ experience of work and enhancing the human value of their services. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Banking; Job Crafting; Job Redesign","","","","","Risk of Automation for Jobs in OECD Countries A Comparative Analysis, (2016); Autor, David H., The skill content of recent technological change: An empirical exploration, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 118, 4, pp. 1279-1333, (2003); What is Job Crafting and Why does It Matter, (2008); Bowen, Glenn A., Naturalistic inquiry and the saturation concept: A research note, Qualitative Research, 8, 1, pp. 137-152, (2008); Bryman, Alan E., Research methods and organization studies, pp. 1-239, (2003); Burrell, Jenna, How the machine ‘thinks’: Understanding opacity in machine learning algorithms, Big Data and Society, 3, 1, (2016); Chartrand, Gabriel, Deep learning: A primer for radiologists, Radiographics, 37, 7, pp. 2113-2131, (2017); de Gennaro, Davide, Job crafting: The art of redesigning a job, pp. 1-184, (2019); Demerouti, Evangelia, Does job crafting assist dealing with organizational changes due to austerity measures?

This research paper thoroughly reviews the literature on the numerous emergent applications of artificial intelligence and its impact on the banking sector. A rigorous study of the available literature is conducted to examine AI's uses in banking. Artificial intelligence improves the banking experience for millions of clients and employees by providing credit score checking, system failure prediction, emergency alarm systems, fraud detection, phishing website detection, liquidity risk assessment, customer loyalty evaluation and intelligence systems by reducing the employee workload. A questionnaire gathered data from 270 consumers in Jordan's banking sector. The SPSS program used exploratory factor analysis to statistically evaluate the sample data to determine service quality and customer satisfaction. The results show that the updated SERVQUAL Model extracted five subscales instead of the eight in the original model. The extracted subscales were tangibility, assurance, reliability, responsiveness, and empathy. According to this study, artificial intelligence is statistically relevant to service quality and customer satisfaction. The updated SERVQUAL model, according to the authors, helps address customer satisfaction in the banking sector. The research findings suggest that the demand for artificial intelligence in the Jordanian banking sector is equally essential for the customers; thus, there should be an optimal balance between virtual and human agents based on the customers' requirements and preferences. Further, this study found practical implications of using AI in banking, particularly those related to Jordanian customer perception. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Customer Experience; Service Quality; The Banking Sector","","","","","Chen, Luyuan, A new failure mode and effects analysis model using Dempster–Shafer evidence theory and grey relational projection method, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 76, pp. 13-20, (2018); Duan, Yanquing Q., Artificial intelligence for decision making in the era of Big Data – evolution, challenges and research agenda, International Journal of Information Management, 48, pp. 63-71, (2019); Filieri, Raffaele, The role of visual cues in eWOM on consumers’ behavioral intention and decisions, Journal of Business Research, 135, pp. 663-675, (2021); Ballestar, María Teresa, Predicting customer quality in e-commerce social networks: a machine learning approach, Review of Managerial Science, 13, 3, pp. 589-603, (2019); Hu, Hanfen, When is enough, enough?

These protocols are manual, work-intensive, and expensive. All of the above have led to a shift towards automatic data-driven approaches to estimate the cf, including Machine Learning (ml) solutions. Unfortunately, as in other sectors of interest, the decision-making processes involved in these solutions lack transparency from the end user's point of view, who must blindly trust their outcomes compared to intelligible traditional manual approaches. In this research, manual and automatic methodologies for cf estimation were reviewed, taking into account their transparency limitations. This analysis led to the proposal of a new explainable ml solution for automatic cf calculations through bank transaction classification. Consideration should be given to the fact that no previous research has considered the explainability of bank transaction classification for this purpose. For classification, different ml models have been employed based on their promising performance in similar problems in the literature, such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Recursive Neural Networks. The results obtained were in the 90 % range for accuracy, precision, and recall evaluation metrics. From their decision paths, the proposed solution estimates the co2 emissions associated with bank transactions. The explainability methodology is based on an agnostic evaluation of the influence of the input terms extracted from the descriptions of transactions using locally interpretable models. The explainability terms were automatically validated using a similarity metric over the descriptions of the target categories. Conclusively, the explanation performance is satisfactory in terms of the proximity of the explanations to the associated activity sector descriptions, endorsing the trustworthiness of the process for a human operator and end users. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking; Carbon Footprint; Explainable Artificial Intelligence; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Decision Making; Forestry; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Learning Algorithms; Learning Systems; Natural Language Processing Systems; Neural Networks; Transparency; Bank Transactions; Data-driven Approach; End-users; Explainable Artificial Intelligence; Greenhouses Gas; Language Processing; Machine-learning; Natural Language Processing; Natural Languages; Performance; Carbon Footprint","Decision making; Forestry; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Transparency; Bank transactions; Data-driven approach; End-users; Explainable artificial intelligence; Greenhouses gas; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Performance; Carbon footprint","","","This work was supported in part by Xunta de Galicia, Spain, under Grant ED481B-2021-118 and Grant ED481B-2022-093; and in part by the Spanish National Funds through Centro Para el Desarrollo Tecnológico Industrial (Center for Industrial Technological Development) under Project EXP00146826/IDI-20220298.","United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, (2025); Global Warming of 1 5°c, (2018); Ecological Economics Research Trends, (2008); Pandey, Divya, Carbon footprint: Current methods of estimation, Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, 178, 1-4, pp. 135-160, (2011); Geopolitics History and International Relations, (2022); Zhu, Naiping, Green financial behavior and green development strategy of Chinese power companies in the context of carbon tax, Journal of Cleaner Production, 245, (2020); Ionescu, Luminiţa, Transitioning to a low-carbon economy: Green financial behavior, climate change mitigation, and environmental energy sustainability, Geopolitics, History, and International Relations, 13, 1, pp. 86-96, (2021); Milfont, Taciano L., The Interplay Between Knowledge, Perceived Efficacy, and Concern About Global Warming and Climate Change: A One-Year Longitudinal Study, Risk Analysis, 32, 6, pp. 1003-1020, (2012); Luís, Sílvia, Raising awareness of climate change causes?

Nevertheless, there is limited investigation into the influence of person-environment fit levels on retirement intentions. OBJECTIVE: This study's purpose was to examine the interactive effect of person-environment fit levels on the intention to pursue bridge employment. More specifically, the authors investigated the mediator and moderator roles of person-organization fit on the relationship between person-vocation fit and the intention to pursue bridge employment within the same organization. METHODS: Data from 246 older executives working in the French banking sector were used to test the hypotheses. RESULTS: The results indicated the existence of a positive and significant relationship between person-vocation fit and the intention to pursue bridge employment within the same organization. Further, the findings confirmed the mediating and moderating roles of person-organization fit on this relationship. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study have theoretically and empirically extended person-environment fit theory, continuity, and role theories to shed light on the underlying mechanisms through which person-vocation fit impact bridge employment intention. The findings of this study can be used by career counsellors and managers to design more effective actions to retain older workers. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bridge Employment; Machine Learning; Person-organization Fit; Person-vocation Fit; Retirement; Bridges; Human Resource Management; Machine Learning; Banking Sectors; Bridge Employment; Interactive Effect; Machine-learning; Older Workers; Person-organization Fit; Person-vocation Fit; Retirement; Role Theory; Theory Theories; Employment","Bridges; Human resource management; Machine learning; Banking sectors; Bridge employment; Interactive effect; Machine-learning; Older workers; Person-organization fit; Person-vocation fit; Retirement; Role theory; Theory theories; Employment","","","","Oxford Handbook of Retirement, (2013); Wöhrmann, Anne Marit, Using Work Values to Predict Post-Retirement Work Intentions, Career Development Quarterly, 64, 2, pp. 98-113, (2016); Jones, David Allen, Organizational and occupational commitment in relation to bridge employment and retirement intentions, Journal of Vocational Behavior, 77, 2, pp. 290-303, (2010); Weckerle, Joelle R., Influences on the bridge employment decision among older USA workers, Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 72, 3, pp. 317-329, (1999); Retirement Reasons Processes and Results, (2003); Raymo, James M., Work at Older Ages in Japan: Variation by Gender and Employment Status, Journals of Gerontology - Series B Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences, 59, 3, pp. S154-S163, (2004); Work Retirement and the Encore Career Elders and the Future of the American Workforce, (2010); Lancee, Bram, Social connectedness and the transition from work to retirement, Journals of Gerontology - Series B Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences, 67 B, 4, pp. 481-490, (2012); Zhan, Yujie, Bridge Employment and Retirees' Health: A Longitudinal Investigation, Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 14, 4, pp. 374-389, (2009); Zhan, Yujie, Domain specific effects of commitment on bridge employment decisions: The moderating role of economic stress, European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology, 22, 3, pp. 362-375, (2013)","","IOS Press BV","","","","","","01672533","","HSMAD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142743645"

For establishing a strong digital banking base, it is crucial for banks to make their processes efficient and fast. The purpose of the paper is to analyze the efficacy of banking functions on implementing Artificial Intelligence for enhancing customer engagement and improving customer satisfaction. It targets banks in metropolitan cities of India having tech-savvy customers, leading a fast-paced life who desire personalization and expect faultless and seamless services. Methodology: The study focusses on front, middle and back-office banking processes. The data for middle and back-office processes is collected through 10 interviews of senior officials and head of IT team in major banks. Literature review and theoretical research is carried out for various international and Indian banks with respect to the integration of AI to improve customer interactions and internal banking processes. For understanding the front-office user experience with AI-Banking, data has been gathered through a survey regarding usage of Chatbots on online banking platforms. A quantitative analysis using the Relative Importance Index reveals major use-cases ranked by customers. Spearman correlation is applied to find the relationship between the two most popular use-cases. Findings: The research paper reveals banking features integrated with AI. Chatbot use-cases on banking platforms are ranked based on customer experience. It is proved that there is a positive correlation (0.247) between the two most popular use-cases. The paper proposes IT Architecture and best practices for the digital banking sector. Practical/Theoretical implications: Based on the complete picture of AI integration with banking operations, evolving Indian banks could focus on the most popular use-cases to attract customers. A comparison with the features developed for various banks may provide a way for growth in the digital banking sector. The correlation between Chatbot use-cases may benefit the established Indian banks to further expand business. Originality/value: Implementation of AI in banking is identified for Indian Banks. It is proved that if a person uses Chatbot for assistance in customer service, they are likely to use Chatbot for recommendation regarding offers and discounts. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Chatbots; Customer Experience; Digital Banking","","","","","Agarwal, Princy, Redefining Banking and Financial Industry through the application of Computational Intelligence, (2019); Belanche, Daniel, Artificial Intelligence in FinTech: understanding robo-advisors adoption among customers, Industrial Management and Data Systems, 119, 7, pp. 1411-1430, (2019); Build Your Own Optical Character Recognition Ocr System Using Googles Tesseract and Opencv, (2020); AI Bank of the Future can Banks Meet the AI Challenge, (2020); A Global View of Financial Life During Covid 19an Update, (2020); Gallego-Gómez, Cristina, Artificial intelligence as an enabling tool for the development of dynamic capabilities in the banking industry, International Journal of Enterprise Information Systems, 16, 3, pp. 20-33, (2020); Hadoop in Banking the Game Changer; Indriasari, Elisa, Digital Banking Transformation: Application of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data Analytics for Leveraging Customer Experience in the Indonesia Banking Sector, pp. 863-868, (2019); Königstorfer, Florian, Applications of Artificial Intelligence in commercial banks – A research agenda for behavioral finance, Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance, 27, (2020); Saas Vs on Premise for Digital Banking 5 Points to Consider, (2020)","","University of Wollongong","","","","","","18342019; 18342000","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141800681"

The adoption of innovative technologies in banking scenarios allows to access old and new financial services but in a faster and more secure, comfortable, rewarding and engaging way. The number, the performances and the seamless integration of these innovations is a driver for banks to retain their customers and avoid costly change of hearts. The literature is rich in works reporting on the use of technology with direct or indirect impact on the experience of banking customers. Some mapping studies about the adoption of technologies in the field exist, but they are specific to particular technologies (e.g., only Artificial Intelligence), or vice versa too generic (e.g., reviewing the adoption of technologies to support any kind of banking process). So a specific research effort on the crossed domain of technology and Customer Experience (CX) is missing. This paper aims to overcome the following gaps: the lack of a comprehensive map of the research made in the field in the past decade; a discussion on the current research trends of top publications and journals is missing; the next research challenges are yet to be identified. To face these limitations, we designed and submitted 7 different queries to pull papers out of 4 popular scientific databases. From an initial set of 6,756 results, we identified a set of 89 primary studies that we thoroughly analyzed. A selection of the top 20% works allowed us to seek the most performant technologies as well as other promising ones that have not been experimented yet in the field.

The components of big data originally consist of volume, velocity, and variety. Once a big set of data has been collected, the extraction of information in terms of classification is of interest for decision making. In this study, we consider the Bank Marketing dataset, which related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. It consists of 36,548 number of instances with 20 attributes and the goal is to predict if the clients will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the performance of the machine learning techniques on the Bank Marketing dataset. A series of machine learning techniques for classification used in this study are Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Random Tree (RT), Naive Bayes classifier (NB), and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN). A comparison is made through percentage of classification accuracy. The results show that the accuracy obtained from all techniques are in the range of 73.40% and 87.11%. The best accuracy 87.11% is obtained from RF method followed by DT with J48 algorithm with accuracy about 87.10%. The worst one 73.40% is produced by kNN method with k=3. Hence RF and J48 methods are suitable to use in classification problem in Bank Marketing data analytics. In addition, by reducing the input attributes from 20 to 5 relevant attributes, the simpler version of J48 model is obtained with the acceptable performance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Big Data; Classification; Decision Tree, Random Forest; K-nearest Neighbor; Machine Learning Techniques; Naive Bayes","","","","We would like to thank the referees for their comments and suggestions on the manuscript.

As a result, the Malaysian government enacted the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009 (Act 701) (hereinafter referred to as “CBMA 2009”) that obligate the arbitrators and judges to refer such Shariah matter to the Shariah Advisory Council (hereinafter referred to as “SAC”) of Bank Negara Malaysia (hereinafter referred to as “BNM”) for its ruling.

Financial institutions including banks implement AI based systems for the aim of meeting the needs of their clients. Although developing economies are bit slower in such adoption, however, they are still making their efforts. The current paper sheds the light on the role of AI in the enhancement of banking sector by exploring how AI based systems contribute in enhancing banking services and developing the trust of clients towards these services, so that developing economies could also adopt such advancements confidently. Consequently, after studying the Jordanian banking system through primary data, incorporating banking employees and clients, the study revealed that AI based systems conduct a central role in enhancing effective risk management, creating convenience, reducing costs and improving clients’ trust towards banking services. Moreover, the study induced that developing countries like Jordan should adopt and implement AI based systems in banking operations and services so that their banking sectors could play a more constructive part of their economies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Banking Services Industry; Chat Bots; Cost Reduction; Mobile Banking; Risk Management; Technological Advancements","","","","Funding: This research is supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research at Zarqa University number: 651147).

Longer the delay in such identification, heavier the cost on an economy. In this article, we apply multiclass classification to classify banks operating in the Indian banking sector as ‘strong’ and ‘weak’ banks. Such classification is expected to provide direction to bankers for bank management. Using average return on equity (ROE) as basis for classification, we apply five machine learning models to the bank data set, namely Naïve Bayes, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbours, random forest and average neural networks. We find that all five models are able to predict the bank classes with a very high degree of accuracy. Ratio of non-performing assets to net advances turned out to be the most important variable in classifying banks as ‘weak’, followed by inflation and real exchange rate.

Application scoring models for potential customers usually perform worse than models for existing customers. This is due to the lender not having access to the financial behavioral data of potential customers. Access to such data about potential customers could therefore increase a bank’s profitability. Open banking application programming interfaces (APIs) provide access to 90 days of historical data on potential customers’ balances and transactions. We examine the performance of credit scoring models developed using such data from a Norwegian bank. We find that traditional regression models perform poorly, while machine learning (ML) methods can provide models that perform satisfactorily based on these data alone. Further, we find that the best performing models are based on an end-to-end deep learning approach, where machine learning algorithms create explanatory variables based on non-aggregated data. These results indicate that data available through the open banking APIs can be an important data source when banks assess the creditworthiness of potential customers. In combination with end-to-end deep learning methods they have the potential to increase the performance of a bank’s application credit scoring models and thus increase the bank’s profitability. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Credit Scoring; Deep Learning; Machine Learning; Open Banking; Probability Of Default; Transaction Data","","","","The authors thank Sparebanken Møre for supplying the data sets used in this paper and for financial support.

It follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist. This research identifies the gaps in Islamic FinTech, which require further studies. Moreover, it highlights the issues raised during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: This study is based on the FinTech business model (BM) classifications by Lee & Shin and Imerman & Fabozzi. Furthermore, the set of challenges used in this study are adopted from research by Lee & Shin and Li & Xu. The Scopus database was used to collect data using nine keywords. Articles and review papers published between 2016 and 2022 were included. Studies that were not published in English, and those with no ranking journals were excluded. The results were presented using bibliometric analysis. Results: The results showed 36 articles discussing Islamic FinTech business trends and challenges, and most of these studies are conducted on FinTech crowdfunding vertical BM. By contrast, the most dominant horizontal BMs are FinTech regulation and FinTech funding BMs. The top challenge found in this study is the regulation management challenges. Moreover, there are remarkable dominating articles and reviews published in 2020 and 2021 discussing COVID-19. Conclusions: This study concluded that many horizontal BMs were not covered in Islamic FinTech, especially horizontal technology BMs. Investment, property and insurance BMs are examples of unavailable articles. Islamic FinTech is considered a promising field due to the size of the opportunities it presents, the available capital, and the great demand for banking and financial products that comply with the Sharia.

The goal of this approach is to build two regions from a training set. Thus, to predict the solvency of borrowers, it suffices to identify which of the two regions has its characteristic vectors; if it does not correspond to any region, credit decision-making requires further analysis. To test our approach, a large set of real and recent credit data obtained from the UCI repository is used, we trained also on a real credit database of a Moroccan bank and the creditworthiness of borrowers is analyzed at using two performance measurement indicators such as classification accuracy and AUC of the ROC curve as a robustness measurement criterion.

Findings from our review show that the practitioner-oriented literature foreshadowed the rise of FinTech by extensively reporting on algorithm-based and electronic trading (2009 onwards), followed by reporting on FinTech start-ups and funding successes (2014 onwards). The practitioner literature subsequently reported on alternative finance models, the introduction of cryptocurrencies, and risks and regulatory issues. Academic literature on FinTech began to rise from 2014 onwards, focusing initially on the development of FinTech in the aftermath of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. Research attention subsequently shifted to FinTech innovations (alternative finance, cryptocurrency and blockchain, machine-based methods for financial analysis and forecasting, including artificial intelligence), as well as risk and regulatory issues. IS work on FinTech started to emerge from 2015 onwards, initially focusing on mobile payment systems and peer-to-peer lending. However, the body of work at the intersection of FinTech and IS is still small. Our review sheds light on several opportunities for future research, including financial inclusion, the impacts arising from COVID-19, and the emergence of new business models, such as Banking as a Service (BaaS). © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Algotrading; Banking As A Service (baas); Covid-19; Cryptocurrency; Financial Inclusion; Literature Review; Machine-based Learning; Regtech; Research Trends; Risk And Regulation; Electronic Money; Finance; Information Systems; Information Use; Machine Learning; Peer To Peer Networks; Risk Assessment; Algotrading; Banking As A Service (baa); Financial Inclusions; Literature Reviews; Machine-based Learning; Regtech; Regulatory Issues; Research Trends; Risk And Regulation; Risk Issues; Covid-19","Electronic money; Finance; Information systems; Information use; Machine learning; Peer to peer networks; Risk assessment; Algotrading; Banking as a service (baa); Financial inclusions; Literature reviews; Machine-based learning; Regtech; Regulatory issues; Research trends; Risk and regulation; Risk issues; COVID-19","","","Martina Linnenluecke is Professor of Environmental Finance and leads the Center for Corporate Sustainability and Environmental Finance at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia.

Additionally, these predicted results may have valuable implications for Indian banking sectors. We evaluated the operational efficiency as cumulative performance for 12 banking sectors as per assumed cut off values of GNPA. It may be varied with other independent variables like credit risk parameters, etc. It is suggested in future to study with parameters of deposit collection and investment to determine credit risk of these banking sectors. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Indian Banking Sectors; Machine Learning Models; Non-performing Assets; Operational Efficiency; Weka Tool","","","","","International Journal of Management Ijm, (2014); Indian Banker IBA Journal, (2005); Iup Journal of Bank Management, (2007); Research Journal of Social Sciences, (2008); Indian Financial System Markets Institutions and Services, (2011); Aima Journal of Management Research, (2013); International Journal of Recent Scientific Research, (2017); International Journal of Management IT Engineering, (2017); Rajagiri Management Journal, (2019); Studi E Note Di Economia, (2010)","","IJETAE Publication House","","","","","","22502459","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132815210"

Practitioners propose different default modeling techniques such as linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, Bayesian approach, and artificial intelligence techniques. The performance of the default prediction is evaluated by the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve using three types of kernels, namely, the polynomial kernel, the linear kernel and the Gaussian kernel. To justify the performance of the model, the study compares the prediction of default by the support vector with the logistic regression using data from a portfolio of particular bank customers. The results of this study showed that the model based on the Support Vector Machine approach with the Radial Basis Function kernel, performs better in prediction, compared to the logistic regression model, with a value of the ROC curve equal to 98%, against 71.7% for the logistic regression model. Also, this paper presents the conception of a support vector machine-based rating tool designed to classify bank customers and determine their probability of default. This probability has been computed empirically and represents the proportion of defaulting customers in each class. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Bank; Credit Risk; Data Mining; Probability Of Default; Scoring","","","","","Machine Learning and Applications an International Journal Mlaij, (2016); Altman, Edward I., Corporate distress diagnosis: Comparisons using linear discriminant analysis and neural networks (the Italian experience), Journal of Banking and Finance, 18, 3, pp. 505-529, (1994); Altman, Edward I., ZETATM analysis A new model to identify bankruptcy risk of corporations, Journal of Banking and Finance, 1, 1, pp. 29-54, (1977); International Journal of Accounting Finance Auditing Management and Economics, (2021); Baesens, Bart M.M., Benchmarking state-of-the-art classification algorithms for credit scoring, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 54, 6, pp. 627-635, (2003); Barron, Andrew R., Universal approximation bounds for superpositions of a sigmoidal function, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 39, 3, pp. 930-945, (1993); Logistic Regression Vs Support Vector Machines Svm, (2019); Bellotti, Anthony Graham, Support vector machines for credit scoring and discovery of significant features, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 2 PART 2, pp. 3302-3308, (2009); Universal Journal of Management, (2018); Bewick, Viv, Statistics review 13: Receiver operating characteristics curves, Critical Care, 8, 6, pp. 508-512, (2004)","","LLC CPC Business Perspectives","","","","","","18167403; 19917074","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132664104"

To keep pace with the ever-changing industry, banks are required to embrace technological advancements. One such technological advancement is artificial intelligence. The banking industry is one of the first adopters of artificial intelligence. Implementation of artificial intelligence has advantages like fraud deduction, enhanced decision-making, enhanced customer experience, etc. and disadvantages like lack of data privacy, employee resistance, unemployment, etc. To realise the full benefit of artificial intelligence, it is a prerequisite for banks to remove barriers. The objective of the present research is to identify and establish relationships among these barriers using total interpretive structural modelling (TISM). The study's result states that lack of talent and qualified workers, regulation policies, data availability and quality and awareness are the critical barriers of artificial intelligence as they lie at the base of the TISM hierarchy. These barriers are also present in the third and fourth clusters of MICMAC analysis signifying these are critical barriers. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Cyber Security; Data Privacy; Total Interpretive Structural Modelling Approach; Artificial Intelligence; Decision Making; Personnel; Banking Industry; Banking Sectors; Customer Experience; Cyber Security; Decisions Makings; Employee Resistance; Interpretive Structural Models; Modeling Approach; Technological Advancement; Total Interpretive Structural Modeling Approach; Data Privacy","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Personnel; Banking industry; Banking sectors; Customer experience; Cyber security; Decisions makings; Employee resistance; Interpretive structural models; Modeling approach; Technological advancement; Total interpretive structural modeling approach; Data privacy","","","","International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security, (2018); Attaran, Mohsen, Blockchain-enabled technology: The emerging technology set to reshape and decentralise many industries, International Journal of Applied Decision Sciences, 12, 4, pp. 424-444, (2019); Attri, Rajesh Kumar, Analysis of barriers of total productive maintenance (TPM), International Journal of System Assurance Engineering and Management, 4, 4, pp. 365-377, (2013); Iosr Journal of Business and Management; Bahrammirzaee, Arash, A comparative survey of artificial intelligence applications in finance: Artificial neural networks, expert system and hybrid intelligent systems, Neural Computing and Applications, 19, 8, pp. 1165-1195, (2010); How Computer Automation Affects Occupations Technology Jobs and Skills, (2016); Article of Live Mint, (2018); Resistance to Change in the Banking Sector A Comparison Between Romanian and Hungarian Credit Institution, (2013); Journal of Emerging Technologies and Innovative Research, (2018); Journal of Financial Transformation, (2019)","","Inderscience Publishers","","","","","","17558085; 17558077","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130175052"

Organizations all around the globe are widely using newly evolving technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning applications to provide the best customer experience. The banking and financial services industry is on the front line to adopt AI-driven technologies in various departments worldwide. However, the adoption rate of these technologies is low in India in comparison with developed economies. In this article, we discussed the significance of various factors (customer satisfaction, AI knowledge among employees, and third-party tie-ups) on implementing the AI-driven technologies from employees’ perspectives at various levels of the organization. We analysed the usefulness of these newly evolving technologies to increase customer satisfaction and studied the role of crucial factors like data security issues and third-party tie-ups on AI technology implementation. The study is based on the primary data collected from 97 employees working in the Indian banking and financial sector across various metro cities of India (Hyderabad, Mumbai, Delhi) in various departments. We identified and analysed various factors that could impact the implementation of the AI-driven technologies at various departments, and we used logistic regression to investigate their significance. Chi-square test was used to check the associations between different factors. The study identifies and examines three key factors—customer satisfaction, AI knowledge among employees, and third-party tie-ups—that could impact AI-driven technologies implementation. According to this study, AI technology considerably decreases the cost and improves the customer experience of services. However, despite of many advantages the adoption rate of AI technology in the Indian banking and financial sector found extremely low. The implications of this study can be extended to the organizations for 360 degrees comprehensive understanding about the AI implementation and repercussions as there is a limited study about this topic from the bottom of the organizational verticals. This analysis is purely based on survey responses received from banking and financial sector employees across various metro cities of India (Hyderabad, Mumbai and Delhi). © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Banking And Financial Industry; Chatbots; Customer Satisfaction; Logistic Regression; Technology","","","","","Financial Express, (2020); Emerj, (2020); Bonney, George Ebow, Logistic regression for dependent binary observations, Biometrics, 43, 4, pp. 951-973, (1987); Banking Finance Law Review, (2019); Analytics India Magazine, (2020); Cheng, Yang, How Do AI-driven Chatbots Impact User Experience?

The data were collected from the annual financial reports of Saudi banks from 2014 to 2018. The Saudi banking sector consists of 11 banks, 4 of which are Islamic. In this study, the major financial ratios are subgrouped into the profitability ratios, managerial practices, asset and loans, capital adequacy ratios, and liquidity. First, regression analysis is implemented with efficiency ratio as a dependent variable and the proxies of banks' profitability, liquidity, asset quality, management ratios, and capital adequacy ratios as independent variables. Next, the feature selection is applied for different prediction models. Subsequently, 4 prediction models (i.e., SVM, CHAID, linear regression, and a neural network) were developed to choose the best fit. The performance metrics have also been evaluated. Regression results exhibit that the efficiency of both conventional and Islamic banks is highly affected by profitability, liquidity, and managerial practices. Finally, we choose the best prediction model with the highest R2 in the training and the testing phases with/out feature selection that is the CHAID model. The best predictors of cost efficiency for Saudi banks are the capital ratios, namely, CAR total and CAR tier 1. Findings are theoretically and practically important to academics, investors, and policymakers. Policymakers can benefit from the novelty of this study in building an early warning system using the CHAID model to predict different financial distress scenarios. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Efficiency; Feature Extraction; Finance; Forecasting; Managers; Quality Control; Regression Analysis; Support Vector Machines; Capital Adequacies; Feature Selection Methods; Features Selection; Machine Learning Models; Managerial Practices; Method Comparison; Neural-networks; Policy Makers; Prediction Modelling; Support Vectors Machine; Profitability","Efficiency; Feature extraction; Finance; Forecasting; Managers; Quality control; Regression analysis; Support vector machines; Capital adequacies; Feature selection methods; Features selection; Machine learning models; Managerial practices; Method comparison; Neural-networks; Policy makers; Prediction modelling; Support vectors machine; Profitability","","","","Journal of Accounting Finance, (2020); al-Najjar, Dania, Key determinants of deposits volume using CAMEL rating system: The case of Saudi banks, PLOS ONE, 16, 12 December, (2021); Assous, Hamzeh F., Can international market indices estimate TASI’s movements?

With the development and evolution of efficient wireless data communication and transmission technology, the study combines theoretical and empirical green credit analysis to analyze listed companies in different industries quantitatively. The index system of credit risk assessment is established through wireless data transmission technology combined with mobile computing and machine learning neural networks. A back-propagation neural network (BPNN) model is confirmed by principal component analysis and factor analysis, and the performance of the model is verified with example data. The results show that the BPNN-based credit risk assessment model can provide 95% accuracy. In addition, 99% of the sample companies have low risk and no green credit risk. However, most companies in the coal industry are at greater risk. Overall, medium and high-risk companies accounted for 11.5%. Compared with other state-of-the-art models, the machine learning neural network adopted here has better data fitting and prediction accuracy, higher learning efficiency, and higher accuracy. The model established inefficient wireless communication is suitable for bank credit risk assessment and has good reference value and practical significance for bank credit risk assessment and management in different industries. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Backpropagation; Coal Industry; Data Communication Systems; Efficiency; Mobile Computing; Neural Networks; Principal Component Analysis; Back-propagation Neural Networks; Credit Risk Assessment; Credit Risk Management; Credit Risks; Green Credits; Mobile-computing; Neural-networks; Risk Assessment And Managements; Wireless Communications; Wireless Data Transmission; Risk Assessment","Backpropagation; Coal industry; Data communication systems; Efficiency; Mobile computing; Neural networks; Principal component analysis; Back-propagation neural networks; Credit risk assessment; Credit risk management; Credit risks; Green credits; Mobile-computing; Neural-networks; Risk assessment and managements; Wireless communications; Wireless data transmission; Risk assessment","","","","Economic Research Journal, (2017); Kruk, Margaret Elizabeth, High-quality health systems in the Sustainable Development Goals era: time for a revolution, The Lancet Global Health, 6, 11, pp. e1196-e1252, (2018); Wang, Ran, The behavior and cognition of ecological civilization among Chinese university students, Journal of Cleaner Production, 243, (2020); He, Lingyun, Green credit, renewable energy investment and green economy development: Empirical analysis based on 150 listed companies of China, Journal of Cleaner Production, 208, pp. 363-372, (2019); Yin, Wei, The determinants of green credit and its impact on the performance of Chinese banks, Journal of Cleaner Production, 286, (2021); Wen, Huwei, Green credit policy, credit allocation efficiency and upgrade of energy-intensive enterprises, Energy Economics, 94, (2021); Li, Jichao, A link prediction method for heterogeneous networks based on BP neural network, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 495, pp. 1-17, (2018); Wang, Baowei, Temperature error correction based on BP neural network in meteorological wireless sensor network, International Journal of Sensor Networks, 23, 4, pp. 265-278, (2017); Cui, Kai, Research on prediction model of geotechnical parameters based on BP neural network, Neural Computing and Applications, 31, 12, pp. 8205-8215, (2019); Yuan, Chengsheng, Difference co-occurrence matrix using BP neural network for fingerprint liveness detection, Soft Computing, 23, 13, pp. 5157-5169, (2019)","","Hindawi Limited","","","","","","15308677; 15308669","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128482158"

Over the years, numerous studies have concluded that news events have a significant impact on forecasting and interpreting the movement of stock prices. The creation of a framework for storing news-articles and collecting information for specific domains is an important and untested problem for the Indian stock market. When online news portals produce financial news articles about many subjects simultaneously, finding news articles that are important to the specific domain is nontrivial. A critical component of the aforementioned system should, therefore, include one module for extracting and storing news articles, and another module for classifying these text documents into a specific domain(s). In the current study, we have performed extensive experiments to classify the financial news articles into the predefined four classes Banking, Non-Banking, Governmental, and Global. The idea of multi-class classification was to extract the Banking news and its most correlated news articles from the pool of financial news articles scraped from various web news portals. The news articles divided into the mentioned classes were imbalanced. Imbalance data is a big difficulty with most classifier learning algorithms. However, as recent works suggest, class imbalances are not in themselves a problem, and degradation in performance is often correlated with certain variables relevant to data distribution, such as the existence in noisy and ambiguous instances in the adjacent class boundaries. A variety of solutions to addressing data imbalances have been proposed recently, over-sampling, down-sampling, and ensemble approach. We have presented the various challenges that occur with data imbalances in multiclass classification and solutions in dealing with these challenges. The paper has also shown a comparison of the performances of various machine learning models with imbalanced data and data balances using sampling and ensemble techniques. From the result, it’s clear that the performance of Random Forest classifier with data balances using the over-sampling technique SMOTE is best in terms of precision, recall, F-1, and accuracy. From the ensemble classifiers, the Balanced Bagging classifier has shown similar results as of the Random Forest classifier with SMOTE. Random forest classifier's accuracy, however, was 100% and it was 99% with the Balanced Bagging classifier. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Class Imbalance; Down-sampling; Ensemble Approaches; Machine Learning; N-grams; Over-sampling Techniques; Tfidf","","","","","Atkins, Adam, Financial news predicts stock market volatility better than close price, Journal of Finance and Data Science, 4, 2, pp. 120-137, (2018); Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Noisy User Generated Text Wnut, (2016); da Costa Albuquerque, Fábio C., A proactive application to monitor truck fleets, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management, 1, pp. 301-304, (2013); McDonald, Daniel M., Transforming open-source documents to terror networks: The arizona terrornet, SS-05-01, pp. 62-69, (2005); Wei, Chih-Ping, Event detection from online news documents for supporting environmental scanning, Decision Support Systems, 36, 4, pp. 385-401, (2004); Steinberg, Martin H., Clinical trials in sickle cell disease: Adopting the combination chemotherapy paradigm, American Journal of Hematology, 83, 1, pp. 1-3, (2008); Xiong, Shufeng, A short text sentiment-topic model for product reviews, Neurocomputing, 297, pp. 94-102, (2018); Abbasi, Ahmed Ali, Selecting attributes for sentiment classification using feature relation networks, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 23, 3, pp. 447-462, (2011); Aggarwal, Charu C., Machine learning for text, pp. 1-493, (2018); Ahmed, Sajid, Hybrid Methods for Class Imbalance Learning Employing Bagging with Sampling Techniques, (2018)","","Universidad Internacional de la Rioja","","","","","","19891660","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127612934"

The unique features of AI models, coupled with the expansion of computing power, make new sources of information (big data) available for creditworthiness assessments. Combined, the use of AI and big data can capture weak signals, whether in the form of interactions or non-linearities between explanatory variables that appear to yield prediction improvements over conventional measures of creditworthiness. At the macroeconomic level, this translates into positive estimates for economic growth. On a micro scale, instead, the use of AI in credit analysis improves financial inclusion and access to credit for traditionally underserved borrowers. However, AI-based credit analysis processes raise enduring concerns due to potential biases and ethical, legal, and regulatory problems. These limits call for the establishment of a new generation of financial regulation introducing the certification of AI algorithms and of data used by banks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Big Data; Credit Analysis; Credit Scoring; Regulation","","","","The authors received no direct funding for this research.","LIA A Lhorizon 2035, (2017); Intelligence Artificielle Enjeux Pour Le Secteur Financier, (2018); Harvard Business Review, (2016); Athey, Susan, Machine Learning Methods That Economists Should Know about, Annual Review of Economics, 11, pp. 685-725, (2019); Economics of Artificial Intelligence an Agenda, (2018); Globotics Upheaval Globalization Robotics and the Future of Work, (2019); Consumer Lending Discrimination in the Fintech Era, (2019); Fintech in Financial Inclusion Machine Learning Applications in Assessing Credit Risk, (2019); Bedi, Pradeep, Basic structure on artificial intelligence: A revolution in risk management and compliance, pp. 570-576, (2020); On the Rise of Fintechs Credit Scoring Using Digital Footprints, (2018)","","Cogent OA","","","","","","23322039","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122824000"

This study is the first to examine whether it can be improved by using system log data that are stoed extensively for system operation. We used the log data recorded by the mobile application system of KakaoBank, a leading internet bank used by more than 14 million people in Korea. After generating candidate variables from KakaoBank’s log data, we created a credit scoring model by utilizing variables with high information values and logistic regression, the most common method for developing credit scoring models in financial institutions. To prove our hypothesis on the improvement of credit scoring model performance, we performed an independent sample t-test using the simulation results of repeated model development and performance measurement based on randomly sampled data. Consequently, the discrimination power of the proposed model using logistic regression (neural network) compared to the credit bureau-based model significantly improved by 1.84 (2.22) percentage points based on the Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistics. The results of this study suggest that a bank can utilize the accumulated log data inside the bank to improve decision-making systems, including credit scoring, at a low cost. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Credit Scoring Model; Data Mining; Fintech; Logistic Regression; Machine Learning; System Log Data; Banking; Credit Provision; Decision Making; Internet; Regression; Simulation; Sustainability; Korea","banking; credit provision; decision making; Internet; regression; simulation; sustainability; Korea","","","","Khashei, Mehdi, A soft intelligent risk evaluation model for credit scoring classification, International Journal of Financial Studies, 3, 3, pp. 411-422, (2015); Journal of Asian Finance Economics and Business, (2021); Munkhdalai, Lkhagvadorj, An empirical comparison of machine-learning methods on bank client credit assessments, Sustainability (Switzerland), 11, 3, (2019); Niu, Beibei, Credit scoring using machine learning by combing social network information: Evidence from peer-to-peer lending, Information (Switzerland), 10, 12, (2019); Dumitrescu, Elena Ivona, Machine learning for credit scoring: Improving logistic regression with non-linear decision-tree effects, European Journal of Operational Research, 297, 3, pp. 1178-1192, (2022); Bussmann, Niklas, Explainable Machine Learning in Credit Risk Management, Computational Economics, 57, 1, pp. 203-216, (2021); Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies and Development, (2019); Luo, Zhichao, SME default prediction framework with the effective use of external public credit data, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 18, (2020); Ali, Qaisar, Does big data analytics enhance sustainability and financial performance?

It is generally unfeasible to perform early scammer detection. Alleviating BCPS threats requires a blend of risk infiltration, sensing, and detection. A secure and robust approach is considerably required for tracking the interacting agent's provided credentials. The classical approaches provided in the literature are less competent, reliable, and accurate. Accordingly, in this paper, we provide the fastest, reliable, and efficient fraud detection approach.

Thus, it appears that the determination of adequate models can help to explain the behavior of agents and result to easier decision making through the anticipation of future prices. For this reason, we will use artificial intelligence models, in particular Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms, in order to better understand the variation of asset prices and their future evolution. In order to do so, we will use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), which has proven to be very suitable in the case of the Moroccan banking sector. The comparison between classical models and advanced artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms has demonstrated the inadequacy of classical statistical models. The latter are based on certain assumptions not verified in the framework of financial series, which reduces the capacity of classical models to correctly predict new data. The integration of AI has also made it possible to overcome the assumption of market efficiency by modeling the behavior of irrational agents, who trade on rumors and false news. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Commerce; Costs; Investments; Learning Algorithms; Recurrent Neural Networks; Adequate Models; Artificial Intelligence Methods; Asset Prices; Banking Sectors; Classical Modeling; Decision Making Tool; Decisions Makings; Forecasting Models; Intelligence Models; Machine-learning; Decision Making","Commerce; Costs; Investments; Learning algorithms; Recurrent neural networks; Adequate models; Artificial intelligence methods; Asset prices; Banking sectors; Classical modeling; Decision making tool; Decisions makings; Forecasting models; Intelligence models; Machine-learning; Decision making","","","","El Afia, A., Adaptive cooperation of multi-swarm particle swarm optimizer-based hidden Markov model, Progress in Artificial Intelligence, 8, 4, pp. 441-452, (2019); Aoun, Oussama, A robust crew pairing based on multi-agent Markov decision processes, pp. 762-768, (2014); Adebiyi, Ayodele Ariyo, Stock price prediction using the ARIMA model, pp. 106-112, (2014); Nonlinear Discriminant Analysis Via Scaling and Ace, (1984); undefined; Algorithmes De Classification Id3 C4 5; Hochreiter, Sepp, The vanishing gradient problem during learning recurrent neural nets and problem solutions, International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems, 6, 2, pp. 107-116, (1998); Application Des Reseaux De Neurones Recurrents A La Formation De Prix A Terme Dans Le Cas De Deux Traders Producteur Consommateur, (2012); Lamothe-Fernández, Prosper, Deep learning methods for modeling bitcoin price, Mathematics, 8, 8, (2020); International Journal of Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, (2017)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","10876545; 08839514","","AAINE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117563926"

This allows us to model interactions and non-linear impacts of any kind without the need of specifying the exact form beforehand. The precision of the quantile forecasts increases up to 30% compared to the benchmark, especially for higher quantiles which are most important in credit risk. By using a novel feature importance measure, we calculate the strength, direction, interactions and other non-linear impacts for every conditional quantile and every variable.

Moreover, we find that the macroeconomy is up to two times more important in USA than in Europe and has large joint impacts in both regions.

Considering potential nonlinearity and interaction in the networked tail risk contagion, we propose an interpretably non-parametric measure based on Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) to estimate interconnectedness across financial institutes. The proposed measure can be utilized to monitor tail risk spillover channels. We apply our proposed measure to investigate the tail risk interconnectedness of the listed banks in China. We find that the tail risks tend to be spilled over within the same type of banks. The empirical result also implies that the bank heavily involved with the interbank business, such as Industrial Bank, is worthy of regulators’ attention. Further analysis shows that the total connectedness of the banking system increases when the financial system is under distress. Finally, we document that state-owned banks are the main tail risk emitters during financial turbulence.

The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the nexus of Artificial Intelligence and Islamic finance based on Islamic finance experts’ opinions and assessments across the globe. Therefore, purposive sampling technique has been applied to collect the opinions. Narrative analysis was used to analyze the data. Henceforth, professors and associate professors were contacted through social networks such as WhatsApp, Facebook and emails messages as the author knows these experts individually. The respondents were chosen from Malaysia, UK, Qatar, Germany, Turkey, Indonesia, Brunei, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, USA, and Pakistan. Data were collected in the duration of one month. Majority of the respondents agreed that Artificial Intelligence can play an important role in almost every area. It can replicate human thinking in technical areas to a great extent. AI/Machine Learning & also Data Science & Data Analytics, can provide solutions involving automation and data…e.g banking services automation, robo-advisors, auto-trading, data services (like Reuters & Bloomberg), commodity trading, wealth management, rating agency services, and software (IOS/Android) development. Blockchain is separate (eg on crypto-currencies, but processing speed is slow) but anyway short term success for IF can be with Machine learning & Data Analytics rather than blockchain, but blockchain technology is improving and opening up new areas of application. Furthermore, in some countries, such as Pakistan, Islamic finance is personality driven. So Artificial Intelligence cannot replace actual persons in the short-run to create a credible trust. In the long-run gradually, it may be possible that robo Shariah advisory may be popular. Technology is important indeed. Maybe artificial ıntelligence will help Islamic finance to make people more financialized which is not good. However, we can look into the issue of how can we use artificial intelligence to support real sector. The Islamic banks are scaring to use partnership based financial instruments as Mudarabah and Musharakah when allocating their funds to customers. The reason is control function. Can artificial ıntelligence help to have the control of those deals? If so it is very good. Nonetheless, this study suggests that it will be great if we can archive such more systems at advance levels, but are we aware of the amount of programming to do that? Having overcome the Main framework, then Islamic Finance mitigation and Sariah framework can be adopted with less efforts. This study explores the needs and potentials of artificial ıntelligence for different avenues as it will improve the performance of Islamic Finance. However, we should specify and narrow it as Islamic finance is very broad. This study, therefore, has opened many future research opportunities in the area of artificial ıntelligence in Islamic Banking and Finance. It discovers many new avenues that contribute to the development of artificial ıntelligence in Islamic Banking. Besides, the present study appears to be the first attempt to discuss the opinions and assessments of the experts of Islamic finance from across the globe. This study also helps to add the value to the existing literature in Islamic fi-nance and financial technology. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Conventional Finance; Digital Banking; Islamic Finance","","","","","Digitalization in Islamic Finance, (2017); Muamalat and Islamic Finance Research, (2008); Bogue, Robert W., The role of artificial intelligence in robotics, Industrial Robot, 41, 2, pp. 119-123, (2014); Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, (2015); Giancaspro, Mark Anthony, Is a ‘smart contract’ really a smart idea?

Although many methods have been proposed to solve this issue as a classification problem, there are few studies that consider customer values in the light of attrition analysis. In this paper, we propose a framework to address this, and we quantify customer values with the use of an improved customer value model, examining them from the perspective of their recency, frequency, monetary value and asset level. We take customer values as the basis of misclassification costs that, in turn, direct machine learning predictive models. The returns for banks in this scenario can be maximized, given various cutoffs and some assumptions. This proposed framework may provide commercial banks with useful insights to better formulate marketing strategies for different groups of customers, as well as to analyze attrition in an economic way, rather than as a simple classification problem. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Churn Prediction; Customer Value; H-measure; Improved Recency–frequency–monetary Value (rfm) Model; Misclassification Costs","","","","We are grateful to Fanyin Zhou (Southwestern University of Finance and Economics) for her comments on using the H-measure in modeling and Yaoyiran Li (Univer-sity of Cambridge) for his help on the calculation of classification costs.

In most cases they led to an increase of the lending cost, and new requirements for money laundering avoidance and prevention of terrorist financing made access to money onerous and hungry for paper. Technology and AI brought an alternative to the market, which proved to be faster, cheaper and with less hurdles. They are all private initiatives, spun up by startups and the wisdom of putting IT knowledge to the service of young entrepreneurs. The crypto assets, blockchain, fintech, digital payments and digital currencies are all part of the new developments. The emergence of technology as the new layout for banking led major financial powers and the international financial institutions to look closer at the challenges they face, and decide that the launch of an official digital currency should not be postponed for too long.

In recent years, machine learning algorithms have been very prolific in this area. This paper describes a systematic approach to building a machine learning predictive model for solving optimization problems in the banking sector. A literature analysis on applying such methods in this particular area is presented. As a direct result of the described research, a universal scenario for forecasting various non-stationary time series in automatic mode was developed. The developed scenario for solving specific banking tasks to improve business efficiency, including optimizing demand for ATMs, forecasting the load on the call center and cash center, is considered. A machine learning methodology in economics that can yield robust and reproducible results and can be reused in solving other similar tasks is described. The methodology described in the article was tested on three cases and showed the ability to generate models that are superior in accuracy to similar predictive models described in the literature by at least three percentage points.

Various research has looked at the relationship between news events and stock prices, but there is little evidence on how different sentiments (negative, neutral, and positive) of such events impact the performance of stocks or indices in comparison to benchmark indices. The goal of this paper is to analyze how a specific banking news event (such as a fraud or a bank merger) and other co-related news events (such as government policies or national elections), as well as the framing of both the news event and news-event sentiment, impair the formation of the respective bank’s stock and the banking index, i.e., Bank Nifty, in Indian stock markets over time. The task is achieved through three phases. In the first phase, we extract the banking and other co-related news events from the pool of financial news. The news events are further categorized into negative, positive, and neutral sentiments in the second phase. This study covers the third phase of our research work, where we analyze the impact of news events concerning sentiments or linguistics in the price movement of the respective bank’s stock, identified or recognized from these news events, against benchmark index Bank Nifty and the banking index against benchmark index Nifty50 for the short to long term. For the short term, we analyzed the movement of banking stock or index to benchmark index in terms of CARs (cumulative abnormal returns) surrounding the publication day (termed as D) of the news event in the event windows of (−1,D), (D,1), (−1,1), (D,5), (−5,−1), and (−5,5). For the long term, we analyzed the movement of banking stock or index to benchmark index in the event windows of (D,30), (−30,−1), (−30,30), (D,60), (−60,−1), and (−60,60). We explore the deep learning model, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, and statistical method CAPM for this research. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Event Study; Machine Learning; Ner; Text Sentiments Classification","","","","Funding: This research was funded by Taif University Researchers Supporting Project number (TURSP-2020/254), Taif University, Taif, Saudi Arabia.","Expert Systems with Applications, (2021); International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technologies, (2014); Rev Behav Financ, (2021); Asian Econ Lett, (2021); Asia Pacific Journal of Management Research and Innovation, (2020); Goel, Tirupam, Bank capital allocation under multiple constraints, Journal of Financial Intermediation, 44, (2020); Ho, Kin Yip, News and return volatility of Chinese bank stocks, International Review of Economics and Finance, 69, pp. 1095-1105, (2020); Carlini, Federico, Don't talk too bad! stock market reactions to bank corporate governance news, Journal of Banking and Finance, 121, (2020); Tetlock, Paul C., Giving content to investor sentiment: The role of media in the stock market, Journal of Finance, 62, 3, pp. 1139-1168, (2007); Xing, Frank Z., Natural language based financial forecasting: a survey, Artificial Intelligence Review, 50, 1, pp. 49-73, (2018)","","MDPI","","","","","","22277390","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121611210"

Speeches usually function as a summary of the current status of a countries economic health, the undergoing trends and some future perspectives of the global economy. In this study departing from classical econometrics we employ natural language processing technologies in combination with machine learning techniques in order to filter out the most important signals in the corpus of speeches and translate into a sentiment index for forecasting the future financial markets behaviour. In our analysis, it is evident that central banker's expectations on economy tend to exhibit a predictive ability for financial markets turmoil. Using a combination of dictionaries which are either predefined or build based on historical speeches of the corpus we train an Extreme Gradient Boosting model that generates a sentiment index which signals turmoil with acceptable accuracy when passing a specific threshold. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Machine Learning; Sentiment Analysis; Text Mining; Xgboost","","","","","How Much Information do Monetary Policy Committees Disclose Evidence from the Fomcs Minutes and Transcripts, (2019); Bennani, Hamza, Does People's Bank of China communication matter?

One of the main issues in the banking and Big Data industry is granting bank facilities to people. The main challenge in evaluating the customers’ credit in the banking industry is that, due to the large volume of the data, it is impossible to review them manually, as we have to use computer algorithms for this purpose. Hence, the accuracy of the algorithm used for this purpose is essential and influential. In this paper, several predictive algorithms are employed on the problem, so that the result would be a prediction based on the combination of the results of each of them. To integrate the results of the algorithms, the weight to each of the algorithms is allocated, which presents the amount of importance of the algorithm in the result. The Ordered weighting averaging is used in this research. By applying these techniques, the proposed algorithms are described in this paper to achieve better accuracy than the existing ones. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accuracy Credit Rating; Big Data; Classification Approach; Cloud Computing; Majority Voting Algorithm; Ordered Weighting Averaging; Rating Bank Customers; Banking; Machine Learning; Banking Industry; Credit Ratings; Large Networks; Large Volumes; Learning Methods; Ordered Weighting Averaging; Prediction-based; Predictive Algorithms; Big Data","Banking; Machine learning; Banking industry; Credit ratings; Large networks; Large volumes; Learning methods; Ordered weighting averaging; Prediction-based; Predictive algorithms; Big data","","","","Javadpour, Amir, A Scalable Feature Selection and Opinion Miner Using Whale Optimization Algorithm, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 1209 CCIS, pp. 237-247, (2020); Abellán, Joaquín, Improving experimental studies about ensembles of classifiers for bankruptcy prediction and credit scoring, Expert Systems with Applications, 41, 8, pp. 3825-3830, (2014); Contemporary Issues in Banking Regulation Governance and Performance, (2018); Journal of Supercomputing, (2020); Creditrisk in the Banking Industry, (2004); 2017 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel Distributed Processing with Application 2017 IEEE Internationl Conference Ubiquitous Communications and Network Computing Pp, (2017); Rezaei, Samira, Automatic fault detection and diagnosis in cellular networks using operations support systems data, pp. 468-473, (2016); undefined; Ukai, Yasuharu, Economic analysis of information system investment in banking industry, pp. 1-235, (2005); undefined","","Springer","","","","","","1572834X; 09296212","","WPCOF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113794161"

The traditional protection systems used by banks based on rules and signatures are proving increasingly insufficient and ineffective in the face of constantly evolving attack techniques. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are becoming dominant problem-solving techniques to fill these gaps. Thus, this article proposes a new approach for optimizing the performance of prediction models for fraud detection in the case of credit cards. Although fraud prediction algorithms have been developed to deal with the problem, they still encounter some very common difficulties due to the imbalance of the data used. Hence, this study proposes a new composition-based algorithm, an approach that combines oversampling and feature selection methods to find the best combination of several supervised classification algorithms.

This study aims to emphasize the importance of customer forecasting and investigate the factors that are effective in determining the number of customer forecasting. Machine learning, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines methods are used. The variables commonly used in the literature, such as number of branches, number of employees, total deposits, total loans, were selected to determine customer estimates by considering the monthly data of deposit banks in the Turkish banking sector for the period 2011-2020. As a result of the analysis, the number of customers estimates of deposit banks in Turkey was successfully obtained. In light of these estimates, it is thought that banks can facilitate the creation of targets for identifying target customers they aim to provide services to in the future. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Neural Networks; Banking; Customer Loyalty; Customer Relations; Customer Satisfaction; Support Vector Machines","","","","","Pazarlamada Guncel Gelismeler, (2018); Dokuz Eylul Universitesi Ktisadi Ve Dari Bilimler Fakultesi Dergisi, (2013); Arasli, Huseyin, A comparison of service quality in the banking industry: Some evidence from Turkish- and Greek-speaking areas in Cyprus, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 23, 7, pp. 508-526, (2005); Proceedings of the International Congress on Business and Marketing, (2019); Mohammad Azamathulla, Hazi Md, Machine Learning Approach to Predict Sediment Load - A Case Study, Clean - Soil, Air, Water, 38, 10, pp. 969-976, (2010); Yapay Sinir Alar Ile Banka Musterilerinin Bankadan Ayrlma Olaslnn Tahmini, (2019); Endustri Muhendislii Dergisi, (2015); Interdisciplinary Description of Complex Systems Indecs, (2016); Turk Bankaclk Sektorunde Musteri Memnuniyetinin Katlm Ve Mevduat Bankalarnda Karslastrmal Olarak Deerlendirilmesi, (2019); Chang, Tungchiung, Application of back-propagation networks in debris flow prediction, Engineering Geology, 85, 3-4, pp. 270-280, (2006)","","Sosyoekonomi Society","","","","","","13055577","","","","Turkish","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192000489"

It is important to find which customer is valid and which is not valid for loan. Now to classify customer’s credit score is used. Based on this credit score of customers the bank will decide whether to approve loan or not. In banks there are major failures due to credit risks. We can automate this by using various Machine learning algorithms to identify loan defaulters. To classify and predict the customers here various Machine learning techniques like gradient boosting, random forest and Feature Selection technique along with Decision Tree are used. Using these algorithms we accurately classify valid and invalid customers for loan. Designed model can classify their customers into good and bad applicants and train the model for getting the better accuracy of the customer data. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Credit Risk; Decision Tree; Ensemble Learning; Gradient Boosting; Loan Defaulters; Machine Learning; Voting Classifier","","","","","Subrahmanyam, K.

This study uses the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric statistic to form a conservative credit-scoring model and to study the impact on modeling performance on the benefit of the credit provider. The findings show that the new credit scoring methodology represents a reasonable coefficient of determination and a very low false-negative rate. It is computationally less expensive with high accuracy with around 18% improvement in Recall/Sensitivity. Because of the recent perspective of continued credit/behavior scoring, our study suggests using this credit score for non-traditional data sources for online loan providers to allow them to study and reveal changes in client behavior over time and choose the reliable unbanked customers, based on their application data.

This paper addresses the following research question: How can socially-minded data-intensive innovation be pursued in the private sector? It reports the findings of a series of five focus groups to explore the role of public deliberation in informing ethical data practices in banking. The findings indicate that deliberative forms of public engagement present valuable opportunities to incorporate diverse views and perspectives and to enable critical reflection on organisational practices and the trajectory of innovation.

Enterprises relying on it benefit from risk management to a certain extent. The value, however, depends on the quality of data. The quality needs to be verified before any use of the data. Specifically, measuring the quality by simulating the real life situation and even forecast it accurately turns into a hot topic. In recent years, there have been numerous researches on the measurement and assessment of data quality. These are yet to utilize a scientific computational method for the measurement and prediction. Current methods either fail to make an accurate prediction or do not consider the correlation and time sequence factors of the data. To address this, we design a model to extend machine learning technique to business applications predicting this. Firstly, we implement the model to detect data noises from a risk dataset according to an international data quality standard from banking industry and then estimate their impacts with Gaussian and Bayesian methods. Secondly, we direct sequential learning in multiple deep neural networks for the prediction with an attention mechanism. The model is experimented with various network methodologies to show the predictive power of machine learning technique and is evaluated by validation data to confirm the model effectiveness. The model is scalable to apply to any industries utilizing big data other than the banking industry. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Big Data; Data Noise; Data Quality; Machine Learning; Prediction; Banking; Bayesian Networks; Big Data; Data Reduction; Deep Learning; Deep Neural Networks; Forecasting; Risk Management; Risk Perception; Accurate Prediction; Attention Mechanisms; Banking Industry; Banking Regulations; Business Applications; Machine Learning Techniques; Network Methodologies; Sequential Learning; Learning Systems","Banking; Bayesian networks; Big data; Data reduction; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Risk management; Risk perception; Accurate prediction; Attention mechanisms; Banking industry; Banking regulations; Business applications; Machine learning techniques; Network methodologies; Sequential learning; Learning systems","","","","Abbasi, Ahmed Ali, Big data research in information systems: Toward an inclusive research agenda, Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 17, 2, pp. 1-32, (2016); Acharya, Viral V., Aggregate risk and the choice between cash and lines of credit, Journal of Finance, 68, 5, pp. 2059-2116, (2013); Aebi, Vincent, Risk management, corporate governance, and bank performance in the financial crisis, Journal of Banking and Finance, 36, 12, pp. 3213-3226, (2012); Apra Prudential Practice Guide Cpg 235managing Data Risk Basel Committee and Others, (2013); Arif, Ahmed, Liquidity risk and performance of banking system, Journal of Financial Regulation and Compliance, 20, 2, pp. 182-195, (2012); Attigeri, Girija V., Credit risk assessment using machine learning algorithms, Advanced Science Letters, 23, 4, pp. 3649-3653, (2017); Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate, (2014); Bakker, Bart, Task clustering and gating for bayesian multitask learning, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 4, 1, pp. 83-99, (2004); Baran, Remigiusz, The IMCOP system for data enrichment and content discovery and delivery, pp. 143-146, (2016); Bengio, Yoshua, Learning Long-Term Dependencies with Gradient Descent is Difficult, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 5, 2, pp. 157-166, (1994)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","2364415X; 23644168","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105988857"

By integrating DeLone and McLean’s information systems success (D&M ISS) model and the expectation confirmation model (ECM) with the factor of trust, the aim of this study was to investigate the determinants of users’ continuance intentions towards chatbot services in the context of banking in Vietnam. A total of 359 questionnaire surveys were collected from a real bank’s chatbot users and analyzed using structural equation modeling. The findings revealed that users’ continuance intentions towards the banks’ chatbot services were influenced by satisfaction, trust, and perceived usefulness, of which trust had the strongest effect. The results also indicate that information quality, system quality, service quality, and confirmation of expectations had significant effects on three drivers of continuance intention in different ways. Our study contributes to the literature by providing a more comprehensive viewpoint to understand the perceptions and reactions of chatbot users in the post-adoption stage. The results of this study also yield several key suggestions for banking service providers on how to increase their customers’ intentions to continue using chatbot services, serving as a basis for long-term and sustainable development strategies in the current digital era. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking; Chatbot; Continuance Intention; D&m Iss; Ecm; Trust; Artificial Intelligence; Banking; Consumption Behavior; Service Provision; Service Quality; Sustainable Development; Viet Nam","artificial intelligence; banking; consumption behavior; service provision; service quality; sustainable development; Viet Nam","","","","Second Machine Age Work Progress and Prosperity in A Time of Brilliant Technologies, (2014); Letheren, Kate, Black, white or grey magic?

Like in-numerous other industries heavily reliant on accurate information, banking supervision stands to benefit greatly from this technological advance. The objective of this review is to provide a compre-hensive walk-through of how the most common ML techniques have been applied to risk assessment in banking, focusing on a supervisory perspective. We searched Google Scholar, Springer Link, and ScienceDirect databases for articles including the search terms “machine learning” and (“bank” or “banking” or “supervision”). No language, date, or Journal filter was applied. Papers were then screened and selected according to their relevance. The final article base consisted of 41 papers and 2 book chapters, 53% of which were published in the top quartile journals in their field. Results are presented in a timeline according to the publication date and categorised by time slots. Credit risk assessment and stress testing are highlighted topics as well as other risk perspectives, with some references to ML application surveys. The most relevant ML techniques encompass k-nearest neigh-bours (KNN), support vector machines (SVM), tree-based models, ensembles, boosting techniques, and artificial neural networks (ANN). Recent trends include developing early warning systems (EWS) for bankruptcy and refining stress testing. One limitation of this study is the paucity of contributions using supervisory data, which justifies the need for additional investigation in this field. However, there is increasing evidence that ML techniques can enhance data analysis and decision making in the banking industry. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking; Ews; Machine Learning; Risk Assessment; Supervision","","","","","Abellán, Joaquín, A comparative study on base classifiers in ensemble methods for credit scoring, Expert Systems with Applications, 73, pp. 1-10, (2017); Ala’raj, Maher, A new hybrid ensemble credit scoring model based on classifiers consensus system approach, Expert Systems with Applications, 64, pp. 36-55, (2016); Alessi, Lucia, Identifying excessive credit growth and leverage, Journal of Financial Stability, 35, pp. 215-225, (2018); Machine Learning in Credit Risk Measuring the Dilemma Between Prediction and Supervisory Cost, (2020); Understanding the Performance of Machine Learning Models to Predict Credit Default A Novel Approach for Supervisory Evaluation, (2021); Altman, Edward I., FINANCIAL RATIOS, DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS AND THE PREDICTION OF CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY, Journal of Finance, 23, 4, pp. 589-609, (1968); Angelini, Eliana, A neural network approach for credit risk evaluation, Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, 48, 4, pp. 733-755, (2008); Antunes, José Américo Pereira, To supervise or to self-supervise: a machine learning based comparison on credit supervision, Financial Innovation, 7, 1, (2021); Boyacioglu, Melek Acar, Predicting bank financial failures using neural networks, support vector machines and multivariate statistical methods: A comparative analysis in the sample of savings deposit insurance fund (SDIF) transferred banks in Turkey, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 2 PART 2, pp. 3355-3366, (2009); Fsi Insights Policy Implement, (2018)","","MDPI AG","","","","","","22279091","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111468653"

A case study of the commercial banking system of New York City demonstrates how a virtual collapse in the space–time structure of its check clearing process led to a transformed information flow environment in which banks had, for the first time, accurate and timely information concerning the decision-making processes of other banks. A dynamical systems model representing the behavior of the banks, both before and after the transformation, demonstrates how their competitive use of this information led to decision-making based on the decisions of others. This process of internal referencing resulted in a structurally unstable state in which perturbations, arising from asymmetric responses to seasonally changing deposit flows, accumulated with little or no decay. This caused loans to diverge from deposits and made the system susceptible to random financial perturbations that led to a banking panic. While the behavior of the aggregate system was structurally unstable, the behavior of the individual banks was stable, with the banks behaving as a coherent group. The internal referencing structural instability is of general significance for the aggregate behavior of geographically distributed systems that undergo a virtual collapse in their space–time structures and a transformation of their information flow fields. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Growth And Change Analysis; Multiagent Systems; Self-organization; Socioeconomic Analysis; Urban Dynamics; Artificial Intelligence; Banking; Geographical Distribution; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Urban Economy; Urban Growth; Urban System; New York [new York (stt)]; New York [united States]; United States","artificial intelligence; banking; geographical distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; urban economy; urban growth; urban system; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States","","","This paper is dedicated to the memory of Elliott Montroll.

Impersonation attacks are an essential concern for internet banking providers. Therefore, user authentication countermeasures based on biometrics, whether physiological or behavioral, have been developed, including those based on touch dynamics biometrics. These measures take into account the unique behavior of a person when interacting with touchscreen devices, thus hindering identitification fraud because it is hard to impersonate natural user behaviors. Behavioral biometric measures also balance security and usability because they are important for human interfaces, thus requiring a measurement process that may be transparent to the user. This paper proposes an improvement to Biotouch, a supervised Machine Learning-based framework for continuous user authentication. The contributions of the proposal comprise the utilization of multiple scopes to create more resilient reasoning models and their respective datasets for the improved Biotouch framework. Another contribution highlighted is the testing of these models to evaluate the imposter False Acceptance Error (FAR). This proposal also improves the flow of data and computation within the improved framework. An evaluation of the multiple scope model proposed provides results between 90.68% and 97.05% for the harmonic mean between recall and precision (F1 Score).

We aim to investigate an AE's potential for detecting complex changes in the liquidity outflows between participants, which could provide an early warning indication for exceptionally large outflows for a participant. As the Canadian financial system has neither faced bank runs nor severe liquidity shocks in recent history, we trained our models on “normal” data and evaluated them out-of-sample using test data drawn from two constructed scenarios: a sample derived from the largest 1% of observed historical multilateral net outflows and a sample drawn from a simulated bank run. In both cases, the trained AE performed well by producing larger than usual reconstruction errors.

Four algebraic directories were used to corroborate the study AI‐based model. The study AI results found risk, trust, facilitating condi-tions, and inadequate digital laws to be the most dominant parameters that affect mobile banking growth in Nigeria, and discovered social influence and service quality to have no influence on Ni-gerians’ resolve to use moveable banking apps. Moreover, the results proved the superiority of AI-based models above the classical models.

We introduce the novel concept of a Triadic Suspicion Graph (TSG for short) which contains three kinds of nodes: goodware, banking trojans, and API packages. We develop a novel feature space based on two classes of scores derived from TSGs: suspicion scores (SUS) and suspicion ranks (SR) - the latter yields a family of features that generalize PageRank. While TSG features (based on SUS/SR scores) provide very high predictive accuracy on their own in predicting recent (2016-2017) ABTs, we show that the combination of TSG features with previously studied lightweight static and dynamic features in the literature yields the highest accuracy in distinguishing ABTs from goodware, while preserving the same accuracy of prior feature combinations in distinguishing ABTs from other Android malware. In particular, \sf {DBank}DBank's overall accuracy in predicting whether an APK is a banking trojan or not is up to 99.9% AUC with 0.3% false positive rate. Moreover, we have already reported two unlabeled APKs from VirusTotal (which \sf {DBank}DBank has detected as ABTs) to the Google Android Security Team - in one case, we discovered it before any of the 63 anti-virus products on VirusTotal did, and in the other case, we beat 62 of 63 anti-viruses on VirusTotal. This suggests that \sf {DBank}DBank is capable of making new discoveries in the wild before other established vendors. We also show that our novel TSG features have some interesting defensive properties as they are robust to knowledge of the training set by an adversary: even if the adversary uses 90% of our training set and uses the exact TSG features that we use, it is difficult for him to infer \sf {DBank}DBank's predictions on APKs. We additionally identify the features that best separate and characterize ABTs from goodware as well as from other Android malware. Finally, we develop a detailed data-driven analysis of five major recent ABT families: FakeToken, Svpeng, Asacub, BankBot, and Marcher, and identify the features that best separate them from goodware and other-malware. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Android Banking Trojans; Graph Models; Machine Learning; Malware; Banking; Computer Viruses; Forecasting; Graph Theory; Learning Systems; Malware; Viruses; Banking Trojans; Behavioral Analysis; Data-driven Analysis; False Positive Rates; Feature Combination; Graph Model; Overall Accuracies; Predictive Accuracy; Android (operating System)","Banking; Computer viruses; Forecasting; Graph theory; Learning systems; Malware; Viruses; Banking trojans; Behavioral analysis; Data-driven analysis; False positive rates; Feature combination; Graph model; Overall accuracies; Predictive accuracy; Android (operating system)","","","We thank the anonymous referees for their excellent comments and suggestions.

Three different feature selection methods are used in order to mitigate the overfitting in the curse of dimensionality of these classification algorithms: one filter method (Chi-squared test and correlation coefficients) and two wrapper methods (forward stepwise selection and backward stepwise selection). The performances of these three methods are discussed using two measures, the mean absolute error and the number of selected features. The methodology is applied for a valuable database of Taiwan. The results suggest that forward stepwise selection yields superior performance in each one of the classification algorithms used.

Distributed devices such as the Internet of Things (IoT) often produce a large amount of data, eventually resulting in big data that can be vital in uncovering hidden patterns, and other insights in numerous fields such as healthcare, banking, and policing. Data related to areas such as healthcare and banking can contain potentially sensitive data that can become public if they are not appropriately sanitized. Federated learning (FedML) is a recently developed distributed machine learning (DML) approach that tries to preserve privacy by bringing the learning of an ML model to data owners’ devices. However, literature shows different attack methods such as membership inference that exploit the vulnerabilities of ML models as well as the coordinating servers to retrieve private data. Hence, FedML needs additional measures to guarantee data privacy. Furthermore, big data often requires more resources than available in a standard computer. This paper addresses these issues by proposing a distributed perturbation algorithm named as DISTPAB, for privacy preservation of horizontally partitioned data. DISTPAB alleviates computational bottlenecks by distributing the task of privacy preservation utilizing the asymmetry of resources of a distributed environment, which can have resource-constrained devices as well as high-performance computers. Experiments show that DISTPAB provides high accuracy, high efficiency, high scalability, and high attack resistance. Further experiments on privacy-preserving FedML show that DISTPAB is an excellent solution to stop privacy leaks in DML while preserving high data utility. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Privacy; Distributed Data Privacy; Distributed Machine Learning; Federated Learning; Privacy Preserving Machine Learning; Banking; Big Data; Health Care; Internet Of Things; Machine Learning; Computational Bottlenecks; Distributed Environments; Distributed Machine Learning; High Performance Computers; Horizontally Partitioned Data; Internet Of Thing (iot); Privacy Preservation; Resourceconstrained Devices; Privacy By Design","Banking; Big data; Health care; Internet of things; Machine learning; Computational bottlenecks; Distributed environments; Distributed machine learning; High performance computers; Horizontally partitioned data; Internet of thing (IOT); Privacy preservation; Resourceconstrained devices; Privacy by design","","","","Tegegne, Tesfa, Enriching queries with user preferences in healthcare, Information Processing and Management, 50, 4, pp. 599-620, (2014); Kim, Ki Joon, Information tailoring and framing in wearable health communication, Information Processing and Management, 53, 2, pp. 351-358, (2017); Şerban, Ovidiu, Real-time processing of social media with SENTINEL: A syndromic surveillance system incorporating deep learning for health classification, Information Processing and Management, 56, 3, pp. 1166-1184, (2019); Khan, Minhaj Ahmad, IoT security: Review, blockchain solutions, and open challenges, Future Generation Computer Systems, 82, pp. 395-411, (2018); Chamikara, M.

To do this I collect every research paper published by advanced economy central banks and examine them using tools from computational linguistics. The analysis points to a shift in the intellectual focus, from a relatively macroeconomic perspective towards a less aggregated view. In part, these changes seem to reflect lessons from the 2008 financial crisis – for example, that macroeconomic models can only get you so far and that microeconomic data are useful for teasing out the causes of aggregate fluctuations. There has been an increase in the amount of research dedicated to the banking and household sectors and a reduction in the amount of intellectual effort invested in modelling the macroeconomy – though some of these shifts had already begun before the crisis. Consistent with this, the similarity of central banking research to that published in top macroeconomic journals has been widening since the crisis. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Communication; Machine Learning; Monetary Policy; Banking; Central Bank; Econometrics; Financial Crisis; Financial Market; Machine Learning; Macroeconomics; Microeconomics; Monetary Policy; Numerical Model","banking; central bank; econometrics; financial crisis; financial market; machine learning; macroeconomics; microeconomics; monetary policy; numerical model","","","","Beyer, Andreas, Foreword - the crisis, ten years after: Lessons learnt for monetary and financial research, Economie et Statistique, 2017, 494-496, pp. 45-64, (2017); Blei, David M., Dynamic topic models, 2006, pp. 113-120, (2006); Blei, David M., Latent Dirichlet allocation, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, 4-5, pp. 993-1022, (2003); Blei, David M., Probabilistic topic models, Communications of the ACM, 55, 4, pp. 77-84, (2012); Great Recession Lessons for Central Bankers, (2012); Chang, Jonathan, Reading tea leaves: How humans interpret topic models, pp. 288-296, (2009); Deerwester, Scott C., Indexing by latent semantic analysis, Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 41, 6, pp. 391-407, (1990); Why the Federal Reserve Failed to See the Financial Crisis of 2008 the Role of Macroeconomics as A Sense Making and Cultural Frame, (2014); Hansen, Stephen E., Transparency and deliberation within the FOMC: A computational linguistics approach, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 133, 2, pp. 801-870, (2018); Hansen, Stephen E., The long-run information effect of central bank communication, Journal of Monetary Economics, 108, pp. 185-202, (2019)","","Blackwell Publishing Ltd","","","","","","09500804; 14676419","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100044023"

In this paper, I propose a new index to detect the idiosyncratic uncertainty banks face at the bank-quarter level by applying natural language processing techniques to earnings conference call transcripts. The index reveals which banks at a given quarter signal more uncertainty about their balance sheets. Higher uncertainty is associated with lower lending and higher liquidity the next quarter, suggesting active management of uncertainty. The active management of uncertainty is more pronounced during periods of high aggregate volatility and for banks with more skin in the game. Using loan level data and firm fixed effects, I control for demand-side factors and find that higher bank level uncertainty is associated with lower loan issuances the following quarter. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking; Credit; D8; E5; G21; G3; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Uncertainty","","","","","Stressed Banks Evidence from the Largest Ever Supervisory Review, (2020); Abbassi, Puriya, Securities trading by banks and credit supply: Micro-evidence from the crisis, Journal of Financial Economics, 121, 3, pp. 569-594, (2016); Altonji, Joseph G., Selection on observed and unobserved variables: Assessing the effectiveness of Catholic schools, Journal of Political Economy, 113, 1, pp. 151-184, (2005); Baker, Scott R., Measuring economic policy uncertainty, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 131, 4, pp. 1593-1636, (2016); Baley, Isaac, Firm uncertainty cycles and the propagation of nominal shocks, American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, 11, 1, pp. 276-337, (2019); Economic Policy Uncertainty and Bank Liquidity Creation, (2018); Review of Economic Studies, (2019); Esparza-Rodríguez, Saúl Alfonso, Chapter 21 The financial accelerator in a quantitative business cycle framework, Handbook of Macroeconomics, 1, PART C, pp. 1341-1393, (1999); Blei, David M., Latent Dirichlet allocation, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, 4-5, pp. 993-1022, (2003); Bowen, Robert M., Do conference calls affect analysts' forecasts?, Accounting Review, 77, 2, pp. 285-316, (2002)","","Springer","","","","","","15730735; 09208550","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088991179"

To improve its services, many applications are communicating with each other. Example, the banking application may read the OTP message from the messenger automatically leading to security issues. The authorized applications installed in the mobile phones are combined as a group and monitored as secure group communications. Each application in the mobile phone is having its Private Key which is called as Member Key and a common key is shared to all the members in the group which is called as group key. To enhance the security of the group communication, the messages are encrypted using group key and decrypted with member key. In dynamic conditions, the fresh group key is generated whenever there is a change in group strength, directly depending on the computation cost and communication cost because of number of multiplication and key sharing to all the members of the group. Though the Tree Based Key Management System has used to maintain lower computation and communication complexity, this research proposes the novel technique which combines the Tree Based Key Management and Machine Learning Techniques to reduce the key generation cost and correspondingly enrich the key security for information sharing. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Key Management; Mobile Application Communication; Secure Group Communication; Banking; Cellular Telephones; Computer Games; Information Management; Learning Systems; Mobile Computing; Public Key Cryptography; Communication Complexity; Group Communications; Key Management; Key Management Systems; Machine Learning Techniques; Mobile Applications; Multimedia Broadcasting; Secure Group Communications; Mobile Security","Banking; Cellular telephones; Computer games; Information management; Learning systems; Mobile computing; Public key cryptography; Communication complexity; Group communications; Key management; Key management systems; Machine learning techniques; Mobile applications; Multimedia broadcasting; Secure group communications; Mobile security","","","","Mao, Yinian, JET: Dynamic join-sexit-tree amortization and scheduling for contributory key management, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 14, 5, pp. 1128-1140, (2006); Gu, Xiaozhuo, Dynamic contributory key management based on weighted-join-exit-tree, Proceedings - IEEE Military Communications Conference MILCOM, (2008); Xu, Chang, TJET: Ternary Join-Exit-Tree Based Dynamic Key Management for Vehicle Platooning, IEEE Access, 5, pp. 26973-26989, (2017); Ali, Shaukat, SGKMP: A scalable group key management protocol, Sustainable Cities and Society, 39, pp. 37-42, (2018); Mao, Yinian, Dynamic join-exit amortization and scheduling for time-efficient group key agreement, Proceedings - IEEE INFOCOM, 4, pp. 2617-2627, (2004); Vijayakumar, Pandi D.R., Computation and communication efficient key distribution protocol for secure multicast communication, KSII Transactions on Internet and Information Systems, 7, 4, pp. 878-894, (2013); Vijayakumar, Pandi D.R., An effective key distribution protocol for secure multicast communication, pp. 102-107, (2010); Vijayakumar, Pandi D.R., Centralized key distribution protocol using the greatest common divisor method, Computers and Mathematics with Applications, 65, 9, pp. 1360-1368, (2013); Vijayakumar, Pandi D.R., Key management and key distribution for secure group communication in mobile and cloud network, Future Generation Computer Systems, 84, pp. 123-125, (2018); Karati, Arijit, Provably secure identity-based signcryption scheme for crowdsourced industrial internet of things environments, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 5, 4, pp. 2904-2914, (2018)","","Springer","","","","","","1572834X; 09296212","","WPCOF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077678426"

Using framework developed by Mohapatra (2019), we find that such parameters that can improve physical interactions with humans and domain processes. This article is an attempt to characterise these challenges and to exhibit a set of key decisional issues that need to be addressed for a cognitive robot to successfully share space and tasks with a human in retial services in a banking domain (Yang et al. in Inf Syst e-Bus Manag 17(1):1–25, 2019). Here, we identify first the needed individual and collaborative cognitive skills from the published framework and then apply them to a case study in retail banking domain. The article discusses each of these abilities, presents working implementations, and shows how they combine in a coherent and original deliberative architecture for human–robot interaction, which can be used for servicing customers (Tobias and Sebastian in Inf Syst e-Bus Manag 16(3):493–546, 2018). Supported by experimental results, we eventually show how explicit knowledge management, both symbolic and geometric, proves to be instrumental to richer and more natural human–robot interactions by pushing for pervasive, human-level semantics within the robot’s deliberative system. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Banking Services; Case Study; Framework; Framework Validation","","","","","J Hous Markets Anal, (2016); Lemaignan, Séverin, ORO, a knowledge management platform for cognitive architectures in robotics, pp. 3548-3553, (2010); Ge, Xin Janet, Modeling Property Prices Using Neural Network Model for Hong Kong, International Real Estate Review, 7, 1, pp. 121-138, (2004); undefined; Catastro, (2004); Analytics are Reshaping Fashions Old School Instincts, (2019); Mohapatra, Sanjay, Using integrated information system for patient benefits: A case study in India, International Journal of Healthcare Management, 8, 4, pp. 262-271, (2015); Mohapatra, Sanjay, An empirical study for finding factors that would optimise productivity and quality in IT business, International Journal of Productivity and Quality Management, 20, 2, pp. 169-196, (2017); Mohapatra, Sanjay, Critical review of literature and development of a framework for application of artificial intelligence in business, International Journal of Enterprise Network Management, 10, 2, pp. 176-185, (2019); Mohapatra, Sanjay, Adopting MOOCs for afforable quality education, Education and Information Technologies, 22, 5, pp. 2027-2053, (2017)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","16179846","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089384728"

This study analyzed the past 12 years of data from all domestic banks in South Korea. The research data include all financial information, such as key operating indicators, major business activities, and general information of the financial supervisory service of South Korea from 2008 to 2019. In this study, machine learning techniques, Random Forest Boruta algorithms, Random Forest Recursive Feature Elimination, and Bayesian Regularization Neural Networks (BRNN) were utilized. Among 1929 variables, this study found 38 most important variables for representing the BIS capital adequacy ratio. An additional comparison was executed to confirm the statistical validity of future prediction performance between BRNN and ordinary least squares (OLS) models. BRNN predicted the BIS capital adequacy ratio more robustly and accurately than the OLS models.

However, there are challenges that impede proper usage, as can be seen in phenotypic characterizations of germplasm banks. The objective of this research was to test and optimize different analysis methods based on ML for the prioritization and selection of morphological descriptors of Rubus spp. 55 descriptors were evaluated in 26 genotypes and the weight of each one and its ability to discriminating capacity was determined. ML methods as random forest (RF), support vector machines, in the linear and radial forms, and neural networks were optimized and compared. Subsequently, the results were validated with two discriminating methods and their variants: hierarchical agglomerative clustering and K-means. The results indicated that RF presented the highest accuracy (0.768) of the methods evaluated, selecting 11 descriptors based on the purity (Gini index), importance, number of connected trees, and significance (p value < 0.05). Additionally, K-means method with optimized descriptors based on RF had greater discriminating power on Rubus spp., accessions according to evaluated statistics.

To test the hypotheses of the underlying research model, the study used cross-sectional research design to collect data from the respondent. Population of the study consists of all banks’ customers that used e-banking services within the Nigerian banking sector. 306 responses from the bank customers were useful for analysis. Data were analysed using PLS-SEM approach with aid of statistical software smartPLS 3.2.8. The result suggests that there is positive and significant relationship between AI quality, satisfaction and continuous usage intention of e-banking services. However, mediation relationship is moderated by the perceived bank reputation in terms of perceived trust. Customer orientation as the second dimension of bank reputation does not moderate the relationship between AI quality, satisfaction and continuous usage. This finding is therefore in line with suggestions that customer value from analytics and AI technologies begins on reputation. While this study recommends managers to support data driven culture through innovative analytical capability by the AI system. It also provide new insights by indicating that building a strong, foundation of trust in transparency on how customer’s data is collected shared, used and protected could boost the relationships. As regard to managerial and theoretical implications, this study contributes to the emerging discussion on the dynamics nature of the relationships between artificial intelligence service quality, satisfaction and continuous usage intention.

However, the adoption of customer service chatbots in banking remains low. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to identify relevant segments of potential banking chatbot users based on technology adoption behavior. Design/Methodology/Approach – Data for the research was collected through an online questionnaire in Romania using the non-probability sampling method. The 287 questionnaires were analyzed using hierarchical and k-means cluster analysis. Findings and implications – The analysis revealed three distinct segments: Innovators (26%), consisting of highly educated young women employed in the business sec-tor; the Late Majority (55%), consisting of young women with higher education degrees who work in services-re-lated fields; and Laggards (19%), consisting of educated middle-aged men employed in the business sector. New significant differences among demographic and banking behavior variables were observed across the profiles of potential banking chatbot user segments. Limitations – The study is based on a non-probability sample collected from only one country, with a rather small sample size. Originality – Technology acceptance variables (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use), expanded to include constructs such as awareness of service, perceived privacy risk, and perceived compatibility, were found to be appro-priate for customer segmentation purposes in the context of chatbot applications based on artificial intelligence.

From the SLR, it is evident that AI has several opportunities for the sector. There are many fin-tech start-ups that offer banking AI solutions, and banking regulators are fostering AI adoption through legislation and collaboration. Other opportunities include the following: personalized services, smart wallets, decision-making and problem-solving, customer satisfaction and loyalty, process automation (especially targeting repetitive tasks), transactional security and cybersecurity improvements, and promotion of digital financial inclusion. Nevertheless, the key banking industry stakeholders have to formulate appropriate strategies aimed at overcoming existing and prospect AI challenges. Among the AI challenges that should be prioritized we include the following: job loss and user acceptance concerns, privacy breaches, creativity and adaptability loss, restrictive implementation and operational requirements, digital divide, availability of vast quality data, AI-business strategy alignment, and loss of emotional “human touch”. However, existing studies are largely descriptive and based on secondary sources of data.

Through experimental analysis, we can see that the system model constructed in this paper has certain effects in the analysis of interest rate fluctuations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Learning Algorithms; Machine Learning; Metadata; Software Testing; Testing; Actual Conditions; Analysis Models; Fluctuation Analysis; Interest Rates; Machine Learning Algorithms; Machine-learning; Model Learning; Stationary And Nonstationary Process; Statistic Modeling; Unit Root Tests; Software Design","Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Metadata; Software testing; Testing; Actual conditions; Analysis models; Fluctuation analysis; Interest rates; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Model learning; Stationary and nonstationary process; Statistic modeling; Unit root tests; Software design","","","","Business and Politics, (2017); Cueva, Carlos, Cortisol and testosterone increase financial risk taking and may destabilize markets, Scientific Reports, 5, (2015); Lee, Chan Jean, Fear, excitement, and financial risk-taking, Cognition and Emotion, 29, 1, pp. 178-187, (2015); Bartram, Söhnke M., How important is financial risk?, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 50, 4, pp. 801-824, (2015); Cooper, William W., Two-stage financial risk tolerance assessment using data envelopment analysis, European Journal of Operational Research, 233, 1, pp. 273-280, (2014); Montford, William J., How gender and financial self-efficacy influence investment risk taking, International Journal of Consumer Studies, 40, 1, pp. 101-106, (2016); International Journal of Finance and Banking Research, (2017); Magendans, J., Psychological determinants of financial buffer saving: the influence of financial risk tolerance and regulatory focus, Journal of Risk Research, 20, 8, pp. 1076-1093, (2017); Cole, Evan S., Identifying hospitals that may be at most financial risk from medicaid disproportionate-share hospital payment cuts, Health Affairs, 33, 11, pp. 2025-2033, (2014); Zalik, Anna, Resource sterilization: reserve replacement, financial risk, and environmental review in Canada's tar sands, Environment and Planning A, 47, 12, pp. 2446-2464, (2015)","","Hindawi Limited","","","","","","16877268; 1687725X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120694612"

It is not only adversely affecting banks but also other financial sectors which depend on them. This makes it imperative to study the ways to prevent them rather than curing the situations. However, banks face two challenges in identifying NPAs and Wilful defaults. The first one is the due diligence of firms/individuals before an extension of the loan. The second one is, need for the placement of automated safeguards to reduce frauds originating out from human behavior. The wilful defaults are committed mainly in loan and credit services for personal benefits and are getting converted into bad loans. Bad loans are the Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) and wilful defaults are a subset of these. Hence, it is very important to control NPAs. The objective of the paper is to design and evaluate machine learning based supervised models for NPA detection. To design models, the entire historical and current data needs to be considered, which requires, faster access to large volumes of heterogeneous data. Hence, the supervised models are implemented using big data techniques for fraud detection and analytics. The various supervised models namely Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Neural Network, and Naive Bayes are designed for loan data and experimented using Map Reduce on Hadoop platform. These models are evaluated considering various performance metrics. The empirical result shows that the Neural Network model performs best considering precision, recall, relative commission error, and kappa statistics for NPA prediction. The best-performed model can be integrated into the existing loan management system for the early identification of NPA cases. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Big Data Approach; Hadoop Platform; Index Terms—loan Frauds; Machine Learning; Non-performing Assets; Supervised Models; Behavioral Research; Big Data; Decision Trees; Logistic Regression; Support Vector Regression; Banking Institutions; Big Data Approach; Financial Institution; Financial Sectors; Hadoop Platforms; Index Terms; Index Term—loan Fraud; Machine-learning; Non-performing Asset; Supervised Model; Crime","Behavioral research; Big data; Decision trees; Logistic regression; Support vector regression; Banking institutions; Big data approach; Financial institution; Financial sectors; Hadoop platforms; Index terms; Index term—loan fraud; Machine-learning; Non-performing asset; Supervised model; Crime","","","","Unpublished Data Show India S Fraud Problems Extend Far Beyond Punjab National Bank, (2018); Pwcs Financial Regtech Insights, (2018); India Banking Fraud Survey Edition II, (2015); Rbi Report of Committee on Data Standardization, (2015); 18 Psbs Hit by 2 480 Cases of Fraud of Rs 32 000 Cr in Q1 Rti, (2019); Zhan, Qing, A loan application fraud detection method based on knowledge graph and neural network, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, Part F137692, pp. 111-115, (2018); Helge Haß, Lars, State-ownership and bank loan contracting: evidence from corporate fraud, European Journal of Finance, 25, 6, pp. 550-567, (2019); Proceedings of 2nd International Conference on Material Engineering and Advanced Manufacturing Technology Meamt Edp Sciences, (2018); Philip, Dibu John, Improved insights on financial health through partially constrained hidden Markov model clustering on loan repayment data, Data Base for Advances in Information Systems, 49, 3, pp. 98-113, (2018); Talavera, Alvaro Lopez, Data mining algorithms for risk detection in bank loans, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 898, pp. 151-159, (2019)","","International Association of Engineers","","","","","","18160948; 1816093X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119960144"

In doing so, the article highlights comparisons between U.S. and international banking and regulatory environments and how these varying conditions impact the development of fintech, especially the fintech that supports social justice rather than intensifying existing injustices. Specifically, the issues of federal pre-emption in the fintech sector are examined. Federal pre-emption deprives consumers of necessary protections from predatory practices. This has especially pernicious implications for people of colour based on a long history of unequal banking rights in the United States. This article finds that the Office’s overreach through the fintech charter erodes protections necessary to ensure that those who are already historically at risk of predatory and discriminatory banking practices are not further compromised by twenty-first century financial systems. Ultimately, this article argues that the adversarial nature of litigation impedes thoughtful development of fintech regulations that support innovation and protect consumers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Banking; Consumer Protection; Financial Technology; Fintech; Office Of The Comptroller Of The Currency","","","","","Brianbrooksocc; Racialized Costs of Banking, (2018); Case for Accelerating Financial Inclusion in Black Communities, (2020); van Loo, Rory, Making innovation more competitive: The case of fintech, UCLA Law Review, 65, 1, pp. 232-279, (2018); Ozdemir, Nilufer, Implications of the Dual Banking System in the US, Atlantic Economic Journal, 44, 1, pp. 91-103, (2016); Brook L Rev, (1987); undefined, (2017); undefined, (1994); Ann Rev Banking Fin L, (2004); Lagarde, Christine, A regulatory approach to Fintech, Finance and Development, 55, 2, pp. 9-10, (2018)","","Sweet and Maxwell-Thomson Reuters","","","","","","23133775","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119601220"

This paper argues, however, that this is far from obvious and identifies when increases in competition are unlikely to arise. There are several key messages. It is argued that, in contrast to the experience in bigtech markets, the widespread use of AI and ML at the sector-wide level is unlikely to lead to any significant short-term changes in concentration in financial markets. In the longer term, however, the question of whether there will be more concentration will depend on the balance of two opposing forces. On the one hand, rapid acceleration of the nascent merging of the boundaries between bigtech and financial markets could increase concentration; but on the other, action around the significant tightening of bespoke regulations, notably regulatory mandated data sharing, could push in the opposite direction. At the micro-market level, it is also argued that the impact of adopting AI and ML will be very sensitive to the specifics of the market (e.g. the impact of any consequent reduction of asymmetry of information is highly sensitive to the underlying asymmetry). © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking; Big Data; Credit Markets; Fintech; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Banking; Competition (economics); Credit Provision; Database; Financial Market; Machine Learning","artificial intelligence; banking; competition (economics); credit provision; database; financial market; machine learning","","","","Assad, Stephanie, Autonomous algorithmic collusion: Economic research and policy implications, Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 37, 3, pp. 459-478, (2021); Machine Learning in Uk Financial Services, (2019); Specialisation in Mortgage Risk Under Basel II, (2017); Berg, Tobias, On the Rise of FinTechs: Credit Scoring Using Digital Footprints, Review of Financial Studies, 33, 7, pp. 2845-2897, (2020); Annual Economic Report, (2019); Calvano, Emilio, Artificial intelligence, algorithmic pricing, and collusion, American Economic Review, 110, 10, pp. 3267-3297, (2020); Review of Network Economics, (2008); Bis Quarterly Review, (2018); undefined, (2020); Market Study into Online Platforms and the Digital Advertising Market in the Uk, (2020)","","Oxford University Press","","","","","","0266903X; 14602121","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117353824"

Different indicators can be used to measure organizational performance and sustain competitive advantage in a global marketplace. The execution of the performance indicators is usually achieved through human resources, which stand as the core element in sustaining the organization in the highly competitive marketplace. It becomes essential to effectively manage human resources strategically and align its strategies with organizational strategies. We adopted a survey research design using a quantitative approach, distributing a structured questionnaire to 305 respondents utilizing efficient sampling techniques. The prediction of bank performance is very crucial since bad performance can result in serious problems for the bank and society, such as bankruptcy and negative influence on the country's economy. Most researchers in the past adopted traditional statistics to build prediction models; however, due to the efficiency of machine learning algorithms, a lot of researchers now apply various machine learning algorithms to various fields, including performance prediction systems. In this study, eight different machine learning algorithms were employed to build performance models to predict the prospective performance of commercial banks in Nigeria based on human resources outcomes (employee skills, attitude, and behavior) through the Python software tool with machine learning libraries and packages. The results of the analysis clearly show that human resources outcomes are crucial in achieving organizational performance, and the models built from the eight machine learning classifier algorithms in this study predict the bank performance as superior with the accuracies of 74-81%. The feature importance was computed with the package in Scikit-learn to show comparative importance or contribution of each feature in the prediction, and employee attitude is rated far more than other features. Nigeria's bank industry should focus more on employee attitude so that the performance can be improved to outstanding class from the current superior class. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Economia Seria Management, (2014); Journal of Naval Science and Engineering, (2010); Global Journal of Human Resource Management, (2016); Delery, John E., Human resource management practices and organizational effectiveness: internal fit matters, Journal of Organizational Effectiveness, 3, 2, pp. 139-163, (2016); Berkery, Elaine, On the Uptake of Flexible Working Arrangements and the Association with Human Resource and Organizational Performance Outcomes, European Management Review, 14, 2, pp. 165-183, (2017); Journal of Social Sciences, (2014); Jayasree, Vikas, A review on data mining in banking sector, American Journal of Applied Sciences, 10, 10, pp. 1160-1165, (2013); International Journal of Emerging Technology and Advanced Engineering, (2013); Lin, Shihwei, Applying enhanced data mining approaches in predicting bank performance: A case of Taiwanese commercial banks, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 9, pp. 11543-11551, (2009); Huang, Zan, Credit rating analysis with support vector machines and neural networks: A market comparative study, Decision Support Systems, 37, 4, pp. 543-558, (2004)","","Hindawi Limited","","","","","","16879724; 16879732","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116626396"

Pandemics usually affect the global economy, and the COVID-19 pandemic is no exception. Many stock markets have fallen over 40%, and companies are shutting down, ending contracts, and issuing voluntary and involuntary leaves for thousands of employees. These economic effects have led to an increase in unemployment rates, crime, and instability. Studying pandemics' economic effects, especially on the stock market, has not been urgent or feasible until recently. However, with advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and the inter-connectivity that social media provides, such research has become possible. In this paper, we propose a COVID-19-based stock market prediction system (C19-SM2) that utilizes social media. Our AI system enables economists to study how COVID-19 pandemic data influence social media and, hence, the stock market. C19-SM2 gathers COVID-19 infection and death cases reported by the authorities and social media data from a geographic area and extracts the sentiments and events that occur in that area. The information is then fed to the support vector machine (SVM) and random forest and random tree classifiers along with current stock market values. Then, the system produces a projection of the stock market's movement during the next day. We tested the system with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) and the Tadawul All Share Index (TASI). Our system achieved a stock market prediction accuracy of 99.71%, substantially higher than the 89.93% accuracy reported in the related literature; the inclusion of COVID-19 data improved accuracy by 9.78%. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Covid-19; Economic Impact; Sentiment Analysis; Stock Market; Classification (of Information); Commerce; Decision Trees; Financial Markets; Forecasting; Sentiment Analysis; Social Networking (online); Support Vector Machines; Banking Failures; Covid-19; Economic Impacts; Economic Recession; Influenza Pandemics; Market Crash; Social Media; Stock Market; Stock Market Prediction; Economic And Social Effects","Classification (of information); Commerce; Decision trees; Financial markets; Forecasting; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Support vector machines; Banking failures; COVID-19; Economic impacts; Economic Recession; Influenza pandemics; Market crash; Social media; Stock market; Stock market prediction; Economic and social effects","","","The author would like to thank the Computer Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) reviwers for their insights and valuable comments that significantly improved the manuscript.

The general types of AI include functional AI, interactive AI, text AI, visual AI and analytic AI. The key components of AI include machine learning, fast Internet connectivity, deep learning, neural networks and advanced data analysis. These components may be complemented by the adoption and use of standard 5G cellular networks. 5G utilises broadband Internet access and Internet connection, and is now employed by some banking institutions, especially in developed countries. It is not clear whether South African banking institutions have adopted 5G for their Internet connectivity and operations. AI and 5G may be used to detect and combat cybercrimes in banking institutions. On the other hand, AI and 5G may also be abused by cybercriminals to commit financial crimes such as money laundering and insider trading. In this regard it is submitted that South African policy makers should carefully revise the Cybercrimes Bill B6-2017 (Cybercrimes Bill) to embrace the use of AI and 5G to detect and combat cybercrimes in South African banks. Accordingly, this article examines the adequacy of the Cybercrimes Bill.

When many banks suffer from the crisis, it can lead to financial instability. According to the impact of the crises, the banking crisis can be divided into two categories, namely systemic and non-systemic crisis. When systemic crises happen, it may cause even stable banks bankrupt. Hence, this paper proposed a random forest for estimating the probability of banking crises as prevention action. Random forest is well-known as a robust technique both in classification and regression, which is far from the intervention of outliers and overfitting. The experiments were then constructed using the financial crisis database, containing a sample of 79 countries in the period 1981-1999 (annual data). This dataset has 521 samples consisting of 164 crisis samples and 357 non-crisis cases. From the experiments, it was concluded that utilizing 90 percent of training data would deliver 0.98 accuracy, 0.92 sensitivity, 1.00 precision, and 0.96 F1-Score as the highest score than other percentages of training data. These results are also better than state-of-the-art methods used in the same dataset. Therefore, the proposed method is shown promising results to predict the probability of banking crises. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking Crises; Machine Learning; Prediction Of Banking Crises; Probability Of Banking Crises; Random Forest; Random Forest Regression","","","","This research was supported financially by the Indonesia Deposit Insurance Corporation research grant scheme.","Ssrn Electronic Journal, (2014); Procedia Economics and Finance, (2012); Ssrn Electronic Journal, (2019); Beutel, Johannes, Does machine learning help us predict banking crises?, Journal of Financial Stability, 45, (2019); Wharton Research Scholars, (2016); International Journal of Recent Technology and Engineering Ijrte, (2019); Random Forest Robustness Variable Importance and Tree Aggregation, (2018); Roy, Marie Hélène, Robustness of random forests for regression, Journal of Nonparametric Statistics, 24, 4, pp. 993-1006, (2012); Biau, Gérard, Analysis of a random forests model, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 13, pp. 1063-1095, (2012); Tang, Cheng, When do random forests fail?, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2018-December, pp. 2983-2993, (2018)","","Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science","","","","","","22528938; 20894872","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107618406"

It is a practice of simulating human intelligence for varied applications. When compared with the standard practices, AI is developing at a rapid rate. AI has proved its worth in several areas such as agriculture, automobile industry, banking and finance, space exploration, artificial creativity, etc. Owing to the efficiency, speed, and independence from human operations, AI is now entering the wastewater treatment sector. This technology has been used for monitoring the performance of the water treatment plants in terms of efficiency parameters, Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) determination, elimination of nitrogen and sulphur, prediction of turbidity and hardness, uptake of contaminants, etc., in the wastewater sector. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Fuzzy Logic Algorithms (FL), and Genetic Algorithms (GA) are the basic three models under AI predominantly used in the wastewater sector. Studies reveal that the determination coefficient values of 0.99 can be attained for COD, BOD, heavy metals and organics removal using ANN and hybrid intelligent systems.

It has advantages such as increasing the efficiency of banking operations, improving resource utilization and increasing banking flexibility for business execution. The retail banks’ branch offices distributed information technology system. Traditional operating systems have limitations which make it difficult for branch banking to support other new user services. Connecting with other bank systems or computer devices poses a difficulty. The method proposed in this paper is based on artificial intelligence and dynamic workflow technology. The method is implemented by an object-oriented and edge computing method, which could be used to create a flexible banking system in an IoT environment, allowing new transaction business processes to be added and modified, requiring real time in cloud computing in IoT. This makes banking user services flexible and more competitive in terms of achieving customer satisfaction. Through this study, we devised a unified process control module to help users implement flexible banking transaction processes, decreasing banking system development time and error rates during banking system development and maintenance. Our process can also increase the usability of banking computer servers and transaction system stability, giving banking services more flexibility and increased competitiveness. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence (ai); Dynamic Workflow; Internet Of Things (iot); Online Transactions; Soft Computing; Artificial Intelligence; Banking; Customer Satisfaction; Online Systems; Process Control; Sales; System Stability; Banking Operations; Computing Methods; Distributed Information; Intelligent Prediction; Process Automation; Resource Utilizations; Transaction Process; Transaction Systems; Internet Of Things","Artificial intelligence; Banking; Customer satisfaction; Online systems; Process control; Sales; System stability; Banking operations; Computing methods; Distributed information; Intelligent prediction; Process automation; Resource utilizations; Transaction process; Transaction systems; Internet of things","","","This work was supported by various scientific research projects carried out in 2020 in colleges and universities of the Education Department of Guangdong Province (No. 2020KTSCX320) and also the Scientific Research Fund of the Key Project of Quality Engineering Teaching Reform in 2020 by Dongguan Vocational and Technical College (JGZD202022).","van der Aalst, Wil M.P., Verification of workflow task structures: a petri-net-based approach, Information Systems, 25, 1, pp. 43-69, (2000); Adams, Michael J., Dynamic workflow, pp. 123-145, (2010); Avenoğlu, Bilgin, A context-aware and workflow-based framework for pervasive environments, Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing, 10, 1, pp. 215-237, (2019); Int J Eng Comput Sci, (2017); Chen, Chienming, Attacks and solutions on a three-party password-based authenticated key exchange protocol for wireless communications, Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing, 10, 8, pp. 3133-3142, (2019); Huang, Xing, FH-OAOS: A fast four-step heuristic for obstacle-avoiding octilinear Steiner tree construction, ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems, 21, 3, (2016); Kumar, Madhu Sudan, Multi-objective workflow scheduling scheme: a multi-criteria decision making approach, Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing, 12, 12, pp. 10789-10808, (2021); Production Workflow Concepts and Techniques, (2000); Lin, Tongchuan, Dynamic workflow of clinical pathway system, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 181 AISC, pp. 109-113, (2013); Lin, Bing, A Pretreatment Workflow Scheduling Approach for Big Data Applications in Multicloud Environments, IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management, 13, 3, pp. 581-594, (2016)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","18685145; 18685137","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104718852"

According to the potential limitations of the conventional EWS and properties of the machine learning algorithm, we assume that an ‘experts voting EWS’ framework can better fit characteristics of data of systemic banking crisis. Indeed, among other machine learning classifiers tested in this paper, random forest classifier simulating experts voting process is the most efficient classifier showing relatively high generalization above 80% area under the receiver operating characteristic curve on constructing the EWS.

Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model was developed to investigate the value-in-use perceptions of AI-based mobile banking applications via five antecedents: baseline perceptions of current bank service delivery; service delivery configuration benefits; general data security; safety perceptions of specific mobile banking services; and perceptions of AI service delivery. Data were collected from 218 respondents and analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings: This study highlights the role and importance of the sequential relationships that impact the assessment of AIMB. The findings suggest that service delivery and the customer’s role in value co-creation change as AI is introduced into a digital self-service technology channel. Furthermore, AIMB offers transaction-oriented (utilitarian) value propositions more so than relationship-oriented (hedonic) value propositions. Research limitations/implications: The sample consisted on digital natives. Additional age cohorts are needed. Practical implications: As financial institutions redirect their business models toward digital self-service technology channels, the need for customers to feel comfortable while interacting with an AI agent will be critical for enhancing the customer experience and firm performance. Originality/value: The authors extend the service-dominant logic (SDL) literature by showing that value co-creation is a function of both firms’ technologies and consumers’ value-in-use, a finding that appears to be unique in the literature. The authors advance the digital transformation literature by evaluating AIMB as an interactive process that requires an understanding of key technology constructs, including perceptions of baseline service relationships, desired service configurations, security and safety issues and whether AI is useful for value co-creation. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first SDL framework that investigates interactive and structural relationships to explain value-in-use perceptions of AIMB. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computer-mediated Environments; Customer Value; Digitalizations; Eservice Quality; Human–computer Interaction; Information Technology; Mobile Marketing; Service Quality; Services Marketing; Structural Equation Modeling; Web 2.0","","","","","Adapa, Sujana, Examining the antecedents and consequences of perceived shopping value through smart retail technology, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 52, (2020); Åkesson, Maria, Regular issue paper: Customer experience from a self-service system perspective, Journal of Service Management, 25, 5, pp. 677-698, (2014); Akhter, Syed H., Impact of Internet Usage Comfort and Internet Technical Comfort on Online Shopping and Online Banking, Journal of International Consumer Marketing, 27, 3, pp. 207-219, (2015); Albashrawi, Mousa, An Integrative Framework on Mobile Banking Success, Information Systems Management, 37, 1, pp. 16-32, (2020); Alzaydi, Zyad M., A review of service quality and service delivery: Towards a customer co-production and customer-integration approach, Business Process Management Journal, 24, 1, pp. 295-328, (2018); Arcand, Manon, Mobile banking service quality and customer relationships, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 35, 7, pp. 1066-1087, (2017); Baabdullah, Abdullah Mohammed A., Consumer use of mobile banking (M-Banking) in Saudi Arabia: Towards an integrated model, International Journal of Information Management, 44, pp. 38-52, (2019); Balapour, Ali, Mobile application security: Role of perceived privacy as the predictor of security perceptions, International Journal of Information Management, 52, (2020); International Journal of Management Science and Information Technology, (2013); Journal of Marketing, (1992)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","20407122","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100007063"

On the other hand, they mainly focus on causal inference and lack systematic quantitative conclusions from the perspective of prediction. This paper is the first to comprehensively investigate the predictability of multidimensional features on commercial bank performance using boosting regression tree. The dimensionality in the financial-related fields is relatively high. There are not only observable price data, financial fundamentals data, etc., but also many unobservable undisclosed data and undisclosed events; more sources of income cannot be explained by existing models. Aiming at the characteristics of commercial bank data, this paper proposes an adaptively reduced step size gradient boosting regression tree algorithm for bank performance evaluation. In this method, a random subsample sampling is performed before training each regression tree. The adaptive reduction step size is used to replace the reduction step size setting of the original algorithm, which overcomes the shortcomings of low accuracy and poor generalization ability of the existing regression decision tree model. Compared to the BIRCH algorithm for classification of existing data, our proposed gradient boosting regression tree algorithm with adaptively reduced step size obtains better classification results. This paper empirically uses data from rural banks in 30 provinces in China to classify the different characteristics of rural banks' performance in order to better evaluate their performance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking; Decision Trees; Machine Learning; Turing Machines; Boosting Regression Trees; Classification Results; Comprehensive Analysis; Current Performance; Decision Tree Modeling; Generalization Ability; Machine Learning Approaches; Original Algorithms; Trees (mathematics)","Banking; Decision trees; Machine learning; Turing machines; Boosting regression trees; Classification results; Comprehensive analysis; Current performance; Decision tree modeling; Generalization ability; Machine learning approaches; Original algorithms; Trees (mathematics)","","","","Bolt, Wilko, Bank competition efficiency in Europe: A frontier approach, Journal of Banking and Finance, 34, 8, pp. 1808-1817, (2010); Paradi, Joseph C., Two-stage evaluation of bank branch efficiency using data envelopment analysis, Omega (United Kingdom), 39, 1, pp. 99-109, (2011); Galagedera, Don U.A., A new network DEA model for mutual fund performance appraisal: An application to U.S. equity mutual funds, Omega (United Kingdom), 77, pp. 168-179, (2018); Machine Learning Technique, (2020); Fukuyama, Hirofumi, A slacks-based inefficiency measure for a two-stage system with bad outputs, Omega (United Kingdom), 38, 5, pp. 398-409, (2010); Tone, Kaoru, Dynamic DEA: A slacks-based measure approach, Omega (United Kingdom), 38, 3-4, pp. 145-156, (2010); Tone, Kaoru, Network DEA: A slacks-based measure approach, European Journal of Operational Research, 197, 1, pp. 243-252, (2009); Tone, Kaoru, Dynamic DEA with network structure: A slacks-based measure approach, Omega (United Kingdom), 42, 1, pp. 124-131, (2014); Ravi, Vadlamani, Soft computing system for bank performance prediction, Applied Soft Computing, 8, 1, pp. 305-315, (2008); Lin, Shihwei, Applying enhanced data mining approaches in predicting bank performance: A case of Taiwanese commercial banks, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 9, pp. 11543-11551, (2009)","","Hindawi Limited","","","","","","10990526; 10762787","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099781859"

A methodology is proposed to identify suspicious users based on their reputation score by collaborating centrality measures and machine learning techniques. The results are validated on two cryptocurrencies network datasets, Bitcoin-OTC, and Bitcoin-Alpha, which contain information of the system formed by the users and the user’s trust score. Results found that the proposed approach provides improved and accurate results.

While explainability in AI has recently received significant attention, the origins of this line of work go back several decades to when AI systems were mainly developed as (knowledge-based) expert systems. Since then, the definition, understanding, and implementation of explainability have been picked up in several lines of research work, namely, expert systems, machine learning, recommender systems, and in approaches to neural-symbolic learning and reasoning, mostly happening during different periods of AI history. In this article, we present a historical perspective of Explainable Artificial Intelligence. We discuss how explainability was mainly conceived in the past, how it is understood in the present and, how it might be understood in the future. We conclude the article by proposing criteria for explanations that we believe will play a crucial role in the development of human-understandable explainable systems.

This paper uses a machine learning technique (random forest regression) to examine whether sovereign ratings account for the potential spillovers from the banking sector to sovereign risk. To do so, we use a panel of sovereign ratings issued by the three main credit rating agencies (CRAs) (Fitch, S&P and Moody’s) for 30 European countries from 2002 to 2016. We find that in addition to the main economic indicators (macroeconomic, government and institutional quality factors), the soundness of the banking system is relevant in determining the sovereign rating. In fact, with the outbreak of the crisis, the importance of these banking sector characteristics (namely, liquidity, concentration and volume of non-performing loans) for sovereign ratings increased substantially.

Different machine learning assembly models have been used in the study, a random forest is developed because it is the most accurate of all those tested. Another novel element of the work is the use of partial dependency graphs (PDP) and individual conditional expectation curves (ICES) to interpret the results that allow observing for specific values how the banking variables vary, when the macro-financial variables vary. It is concluded that the most determining variables to predict bank solvency in the United States are interest rates, specifically the mortgage rate and the 5 and 10-year interest rates of treasury bonds, reducing solvency as these rates increase. For delinquency, the most important variable is the unemployment rate in the forecast. The financial stability index is made up of the normalized difference between the two factors obtained, one for solvency and the other for delinquency. The index prediction concludes that stability worsens as BBB corporate yield increases. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Delinquency; Ices Curves; Random Forest; Solvency","","","","","Identifying Excessive Credit Growth and Leverage, (2014); Apley, Daniel W., Visualizing the effects of predictor variables in black box supervised learning models, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

Subsequently, we used machine learning methods to predict efficient FIs from qualitative attributes. Finally, we tested the variables related to the attributes, using a fractionated logistic regression controlled by economic-financial variables. As main results, we found that attributes linked to political-administrative localization criteria were the more important attribute in predicting if the FI was in the efficient group; we confirmed the recent findings of the literature that state that less governmental influence (freedom) is related to more efficient institutions.

In this paper, we employ the machine learning techniques- a subset of artificial intelligence- in order to predict the credit ratings for the banks in GCC. The quarterly dataset of the macro and bank specific variables was used for a period that spanned between the years 2010 to 2018, with an out of sample prediction, for three years. Our findings suggest that arbitrary forests demonstrate the highest precision, based on the F1 score, specificity, and the accuracy scores. This precision remained robust for all the classes of the ratings, ranging from the highest credit quality to the default mode as well. Moreover, our findings also revealed that the Artificial Neural Networks are ranked second for the overall predictions that have been made. However, for the speculative and default grades, our findings suggest that the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) are significantly relevant, and although their precision is less than the random forests, the difference is not significant. Therefore, we propose that, for the stressed banks, both random forests and the CART should be employed, for a better and more informed risk assessment.

This situation is commonly known as the “best practice trap”. Motivated by such observation, the purpose of the present paper is to develop a practical methodology to support better practice benchmarking, with an application to the banking sector. In this sense, we develop a two-stage hybrid model that employs Artificial Neural Network (ANN) via integration with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which is used as a preprocessor, to investigate the ability of the DEA-ANN approach to classify the sampled branches of a Greek bank into predefined efficiency classes. ANN is integrated with a family of radial and non-radial DEA models. This combined approach effectively captures the information contained in the characteristics of the sampled branches, and subsequently demonstrates a satisfactory classification ability especially for the efficient branches. Our prediction results are presented using four performance measures (hit rates): percent success rate of classifying a bank branch's performance exactly or within one class of its actual performance, as well as just one class above the actual class and just one class below the actual class. The proposed modeling approach integrates the DEA context with ANN and advances benchmarking practices to enhance the decision-making process for efficiency improvement. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Artificial Neural Network; Banking; Benchmarking; Best Practice; Data Envelopment Analysis; Performance; Classification (of Information); Data Envelopment Analysis; Decision Making; Efficiency; Neural Networks; Banking Sectors; Classification Ability; Decision Making Process; Efficiency Improvement; Model Approach; Non-radial Dea Models; Performance Assessment; Performance Measure; Benchmarking","Classification (of information); Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Efficiency; Neural networks; Banking sectors; Classification ability; Decision making process; Efficiency improvement; Model approach; Non-radial DEA models; Performance assessment; Performance measure; Benchmarking","","","","Agarwal, Renu, Determinants of quality management practices: An empirical study of New Zealand manufacturing firms, International Journal of Production Economics, 142, 1, pp. 130-145, (2013); Ahmad, Muhammad Waseem, Trees vs Neurons: Comparison between random forest and ANN for high-resolution prediction of building energy consumption, Energy and Buildings, 147, pp. 77-89, (2017); International Research Journal of Finance and Economics, (2006); Athanassopoulos, Antreas D., A comparison of data envelopment analysis and artificial neural networks as tools for assessing the efficiency of decision making units, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 47, 8, pp. 1000-1016, (1996); Azadeh, Ali H., Forecasting electrical consumption by integration of Neural Network, time series and ANOVA, Applied Mathematics and Computation, 186, 2, pp. 1753-1761, (2007); Banker, Rajiv D., SOME MODELS FOR ESTIMATING TECHNICAL AND SCALE INEFFICIENCIES IN DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS., Management Science, 30, 9, pp. 1078-1092, (1984); Byrnes, Patricia, MEASURING PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY: AN APPLICATION TO ILLINOIS STRIP MINES., Management Science, 30, 6, pp. 671-681, (1984); Çelebi, Dilay, An integrated neural network and data envelopment analysis for supplier evaluation under incomplete information, Expert Systems with Applications, 35, 4, pp. 1698-1710, (2008); Charles, Vincent, The curse of dimensionality of decision-making units: A simple approach to increase the discriminatory power of data envelopment analysis, European Journal of Operational Research, 279, 3, pp. 929-940, (2019); Icpe Public Enterprise Half Yearly Journal, (2016)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09574174","","ESAPE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086997462"

The National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) provided 799233 complete patient records (778303 survivors and 20930 deaths) each containing 32 features, a number further reduced to only 8 features via the permutation importance method. Importantly, the 8 features can all be readily determined at admission: systolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, oxygen saturation, gender, age and Glasgow coma score. Since death was rare, a rebalanced training set was used to train the model. The model is able to predict a survival probability for any trauma patient and accurately distinguish between a deceased and survived patient in 92.4% of all cases. Partial dependence curves (P<inf>survival</inf> vs. feature value) obtained from the trained model revealed the global importance of Glasgow coma score, age, and systolic blood pressure while pulse rate, respiratory rate, temperature, oxygen saturation, and gender had more subtle single variable influences. Shapley values, which measure the relative contribution of each of the 8 features to individual patient risk, were computed for several patients and were able to quantify patient-specific warning signs. Using the NTDB to sample across numerous patient traumas and hospital protocols, the trained model and Shapley values rapidly provides quantitative insight into which combination of variables in an 8-dimensional space contributed most to each trauma patient’s predicted global risk of death upon emergency room admission. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adult; Age; Aged; Article; Body Temperature; Breathing Rate; Data Base; Emergency Ward; Feature Selection; Female; Gender; Glasgow Coma Scale; Hospital Admission; Human; Injury; Machine Learning; Major Clinical Study; Male; Mortality Rate; National Trauma Data Bank; Oxygen Saturation; Patient Risk; Prediction; Pulse Rate; Risk Factor; Survival Rate; Systolic Blood Pressure; Algorithm; Factual Database; False Positive Result; Heart Rate; Hospitalization; Injury Scale; Mortality; Probability; Receiver Operating Characteristic; Reproducibility; Risk; Sex Factor; Algorithms; Databases, Factual; False Positive Reactions; Glasgow Coma Scale; Heart Rate; Hospitalization; Humans; Injury Severity Score; Machine Learning; Probability; Reproducibility Of Results; Risk; Roc Curve; Sex Factors; Wounds And Injuries","adult; age; aged; Article; body temperature; breathing rate; data base; emergency ward; feature selection; female; gender; Glasgow coma scale; hospital admission; human; injury; machine learning; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; national trauma data bank; oxygen saturation; patient risk; prediction; pulse rate; risk factor; survival rate; systolic blood pressure; algorithm; factual database; false positive result; heart rate; hospitalization; injury scale; mortality; probability; receiver operating characteristic; reproducibility; risk; sex factor; Algorithms; Databases, Factual; False Positive Reactions; Glasgow Coma Scale; Heart Rate; Hospitalization; Humans; Injury Severity Score; Machine Learning; Probability; Reproducibility of Results; Risk; ROC Curve; Sex Factors; Wounds and Injuries","","","This work was supported by NIH UO1-HL-131053 (S.L.D, T.S.)

We find that there is a significant long-run cost in terms of both happiness and unemployment, which primarily affects the most vulnerable portion of the population. In addition, despite the expected instability in City's financial centre, the UK financial sector seems to be well equipped to deal with the repercussions, thus minimising the welfare costs for the country.

Today, various AI applications are being used in areas ranging from marketing to banking and finance, from agriculture to healthcare and security, from space exploration to robotics and transport, and from chatbots to artificial creativity and manufacturing. More recently, AI applications have also started to become an integral part of many urban services. Urban artificial intelligences manage the transport systems of cities, run restaurants and shops where every day urbanity is expressed, repair urban infrastructure, and govern multiple urban domains such as traffic, air quality monitoring, garbage collection, and energy. In the age of uncertainty and complexity that is upon us, the increasing adoption of AI is expected to continue, and so its impact on the sustainability of our cities. This viewpoint explores and questions the sustainability of AI from the lens of smart and sustainable cities, and generates insights into emerging urban artificial intelligences and the potential symbiosis between AI and a smart and sustainable urbanism. In terms of methodology, this viewpoint deploys a thorough review of the current status of AI and smart and sustainable cities literature, research, developments, trends, and applications. In so doing, it contributes to existing academic debates in the fields of smart and sustainable cities and AI. In addition, by shedding light on the uptake of AI in cities, the viewpoint seeks to help urban policymakers, planners, and citizens make informed decisions about a sustainable adoption of AI. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence (ai); Artificially Intelligent City; Climate Change; Planetary Challenges; Smart And Sustainable Cities; Smart City; Sustainable Urbanism; Technological Disruption; Urban Artificial Intelligences; Urban Policy; Air Quality; Artificial Intelligence; Atmospheric Pollution; Banking; Financial Market; Marketing; Robotics; Sustainable Development; Trend Analysis; Urban Area","air quality; artificial intelligence; atmospheric pollution; banking; financial market; marketing; robotics; sustainable development; trend analysis; urban area","","","","Kassens-Noor, Eva, Cities of the Future?

This paper employs a machine learning approach to examine the digitalization process of bank customers using a comprehensive consumer finance survey. By employing a set of algorithms (random forests, conditional inference trees and causal forests) this paper identities the features predicting bank customers’ digitalization process, illustrates the sequence of consumers’ decision-making actions and explores the existence of causal relationships in the digitalization process. Random forests are found to provide the highest performance–they accurately predict 88.41% of bank customers’ online banking adoption and usage decisions. We find that the adoption of digital banking services begins with information-based services (e.g., checking account balance), conditional on the awareness of the range of online services by customers, and then is followed by transactional services (e.g., online/mobile money transfer). The diversification of the use of online channels is explained by the consciousness about the range of services available and the safety perception. A certain degree of complementarity between bank and non-bank digital channels is also found. The treatment effect estimations of the causal forest algorithms confirm causality of the identified explanatory factors. These results suggest that banks should address the digital transformation of their customers by segmenting them according to their revealed preferences and offering them personalized digital services. Additionally, policymakers should promote financial digitalization, designing policies oriented towards making consumers aware of the range of online services available. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adoption; Article; Awareness; Bank Account; Consciousness; Consumer; Decision Making; Finance; Human; Human Experiment; Information Service; Money; Perception; Random Forest; Adult; Aged; Consumer Attitude; Female; Internet; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Procedures; Young Adult; Adult; Aged; Banking, Personal; Consumer Behavior; Decision Making; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult","adoption; article; awareness; bank account; consciousness; consumer; decision making; finance; human; human experiment; information service; money; perception; random forest; adult; aged; consumer attitude; female; Internet; machine learning; male; middle aged; procedures; young adult; Adult; Aged; Banking, Personal; Consumer Behavior; Decision Making; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult","","","Financial support from the FUNCAS Foundation, PGC2018 – 099415 – B – 100 MICINN/FEDER/UE, and Junta de Andalucía P18-RT-3571 Project and P12.SEJ.2463 (Excellence Groups) is gratefully acknowledged.

In order to achieve efficient modeling of bank data transactions, Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Neural network (NN) classifiers are used in this paper. Initially, the bank transaction data such as transaction count and amount are subjected to feature extraction to extract the statistical features. Now, the extracted data are modeled using the combination of DBN and NN models, where the average modeled output from both the network is considered as the final result. The above procedure is utilized for the two prediction models such as transaction count and transaction amount. Moreover, the transaction count from prediction model 1 is subjected to the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to compute the relationship between the transition count and transition amount. Here, as the main contribution, the number of hidden neurons in both DBN and NN are optimized or tuned accurately using the hybridized optimization models with Lion Algorithm (LA), and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) named L-ABC model. The average of entire transactional amounts, i.e. the modeled outputs are matched with the actual data to validate the performance of the implemented model. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm; Bank Data Transaction; Deep Belief Network; Lion Algorithm; Neural Network; Time Series Modeling; Autoregressive Moving Average Model; Data Mining; Deep Learning; Forecasting; Optimization; Artificial Bee Colonies (abc); Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average Models; Deep Belief Network (dbn); Hybrid Machine Learning; Neural Network (nn); Number Of Hidden Neurons; Optimization Models; Statistical Features; Predictive Analytics","Autoregressive moving average model; Data mining; Deep learning; Forecasting; Optimization; Artificial bee colonies (ABC); Auto regressive integrated moving average models; Deep belief network (DBN); Hybrid machine learning; Neural network (nn); Number of hidden neurons; Optimization models; Statistical features; Predictive analytics","","","","Bansal, Neha, Fuzzy AHP approach for legal judgement summarization, Journal of Management Analytics, 6, 3, pp. 323-340, (2019); Behbood, Vahid, Fuzzy refinement domain adaptation for long term prediction in banking ecosystem, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 10, 2, pp. 1637-1646, (2014); Boothalingam, Rajakumar, Optimization using lion algorithm: a biological inspiration from lion’s social behavior, Evolutionary Intelligence, 11, 1-2, pp. 31-52, (2018); Calheiros, Rodrigo Neves, Workload prediction using ARIMA model and its impact on cloud applications' QoS, IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing, 3, 4, pp. 449-458, (2015); Chen, Xudong, Foreign entry and bank competition on financial products in China: A model of bank size, Pacific Basin Finance Journal, 49, pp. 43-59, (2018); Chong, Dazhi, The impact of XBRL on information asymmetry: evidence from loan contracting, Journal of Management Analytics, 4, 2, pp. 145-158, (2017); Clempner, Julio Bernardo, Optimal Marketing Strategies for Modeling Real Settings: Improving The Multichannel in Banking, IEEE Latin America Transactions, 13, 7, pp. 2411-2415, (2015); de Lisa, Riccardo, Modelling Deposit Insurance Scheme Losses in a Basel 2 Framework, Journal of Financial Services Research, 40, 3, pp. 123-141, (2011); Fister, Iztok, A comprehensive review of firefly algorithms, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 13, pp. 34-46, (2013); Fukuyama, Hirofumi, Modelling bank performance: A network DEA approach, European Journal of Operational Research, 259, 2, pp. 721-732, (2017)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","23270012; 23270039","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083666485"

Aim: To improve accuracy and reduce bias in endothelial cell density (ECD) quantification by combining Gabor-domain optical coherence microscopy (GDOCM) for three-dimensional, wide field-of-view (1 mm2) corneal imaging and machine learning for automatic delineation of endothelial cell boundaries. Approach: Human corneas stored in viewing chambers were imaged over a wide field-of-view with GDOCM without contacting the specimens. Numerical methods were applied to compensate for the natural curvature of the cornea and produce an image of the flattened endothelium. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to automatically delineate the cell boundaries using 180 manually annotated images from six corneas. Ten additional corneas were imaged with GDOCM and compared with specular microscopy (SM) to determine performance of the combined GDOCM and CNN to achieve automated endothelial counts relative to current procedural standards. Results: Cells could be imaged over a larger area with GDOCM than SM, and more cells could be delineated via automatic cell segmentation than via manual methods. ECD obtained from automatic cell segmentation of GDOCM images yielded a correlation of 0.94 (p < 0.001) with the manual segmentation on the same images, and correlation of 0.91 (p < 0.001) with the corresponding manually counted SM results. Conclusions: Automated endothelial cell counting on GDOCM images with large field of view eliminates selection bias and reduces sampling error, which both affect the gold standard of manual counting on SM images. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Corneal Imaging; Eye Banking; Machine Learning; Microscopy; Ophthalmology; Optical Coherence Tomography; Automation; Convolutional Neural Networks; Endothelial Cells; Image Segmentation; Machine Learning; Numerical Methods; Tissue; Automatic Segmentations; Cell Segmentation; Corneal Transplantation; Large Field Of Views; Manual Segmentation; Optical Coherence Microscopy; Viewing Chambers; Wide Field Of View; Cytology; Article; Cell Counting; Cell Density; Controlled Study; Convolutional Neural Network; Cornea Tissue; Endothelium Cell; Gold Standard; Human; Human Cell; Human Experiment; Human Tissue; Ophthalmology; Optical Coherence Tomography; Sampling Error; Selection Bias; Specular Microscopy; Cornea; Cornea Endothelium; Diagnostic Imaging; Machine Learning; Microscopy; Cornea; Endothelial Cells; Endothelium, Corneal; Humans; Machine Learning; Microscopy","Automation; Convolutional neural networks; Endothelial cells; Image segmentation; Machine learning; Numerical methods; Tissue; Automatic segmentations; Cell segmentation; Corneal transplantation; Large field of views; Manual segmentation; Optical coherence microscopy; Viewing chambers; Wide field of view; Cytology; article; cell counting; cell density; controlled study; convolutional neural network; cornea tissue; endothelium cell; gold standard; human; human cell; human experiment; human tissue; ophthalmology; optical coherence tomography; sampling error; selection bias; specular microscopy; cornea; cornea endothelium; diagnostic imaging; machine learning; microscopy; Cornea; Endothelial Cells; Endothelium, Corneal; Humans; Machine Learning; Microscopy","","","The authors thank Changsik Yoon, Amanda Mietus, and Yue Qi (University of Rochester) for providing the manually annotated data on six corneas.

In banking, the first applications of AI were successful; however, AI is mainly applied in investment banking and backend services without customer contact. AI in commercial banking with its focus on customer interaction has received little attention so far. Introducing AI in commercial banking could change business processes and interactions with customers, which could create research opportunities for behavioral finance. Based on this research gap, we conducted a structured literature review to identify applications of AI in commercial banks and the challenges of implementing AI. Our findings suggest that by using AI, commercial banks can reduce losses in lending, increase security in processing payments, automate compliance-related work, and improve customer targeting. Researchers worry about realizing technological advantages; the embedding of AI in business processes; ensuring user acceptance through transparency; privacy; and suitable documentation.

The study took place in the Palestinian context with a global comparison among these generations. The authors used the questionnaire-based technique to meet the study objective. West Bank respondents were selected for this purpose; the study instrument was distributed through different social media channels. The findings show that reliability/trust and ease of use are the main issues in using a financial service. Millennials are more aware (48%) of Fintech services than Gen Z (38%), which is different from the global view where Gen Z is the highest. The smartphone penetration rate is 100% among both generations, while the financial inclusion ratio in Palestine is around 36.4%; these clear indicators are the main Fintech drivers to promote Fintech services in Palestine, and these are global indicators for Fintech adoption intention. Both generations (84%) intend to use e-wallet services, Millennials (87%) and Gen Z is (70%) prefer using real-time services. Half of the respondents see that Fintech plays a complementary role with banks. The majority see that Fintech services are cheaper than bank services. Wealth management, and robot advisor services, and both generations are looking to acquire them in the long run. The authors revealed that 85% of respondents from both generations trust banks, so it is recommended that banks digitize their financial services to meet the customers' needs, considering that 90% of respondents see that promotions are a key issue in adopting Fintech services.

Prolonged ELB episodes are easy to generate with foreign shocks, unlike with domestic shocks.

The main objective of this paper consists in analyzing bank experiences when they introduce AI from the theory of dynamic capabilities and the resource-based view approach. Documentary research enables the description of experiences in three companies from the financial industry. It has been considered of interest to include different international experiences. For that reason, a firm providing debit and credit card services has been included, MasterCard, along with international banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland and Caixa Bank. Results show that AI enables firms to promote new relationships with customers, detect their needs or experiences, and adapt the service given by firms to be more competitive.

In this study, we examine decision quality and visual information foraging for DSSs with different known reliability levels. Thirty-six participants completed a financial fraud detection task, first unsupported and then supported by a DSS which highlighted important information sources. Participants were randomly allocated to four cohorts, being informed that the system's reliability was 100%, 90%, 80% or undisclosed. Results showed that only a DSS known to be 100% reliable resulted in participants systematically following its suggestions, increasing the percentage of correct classifications to a median of 100% while halving both, decision time and number of visually attended information sources. In all other conditions, the DSS had no effect on most visual sampling metrics, while decision quality of the human-DSS team was below the reliability level of the DSS. Knowledge of an even slightly unreliable system hence had a profound impact on joint decision making, with participants trusting their significantly worse performance more than the DSSs suggestions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Classification (of Information); Decision Making; Reliability; Decision Quality; Decision Support System (dsss); Decision Supports; Financial Fraud Detections; Information Sources; Joint Decision Making; Reliability Level; Visual Information; Decision Support Systems; Adult; Article; Clinical Article; Cohort Analysis; Controlled Study; Decision Support System; Female; Foraging; Fraud; Human; Human Experiment; Male; Randomized Controlled Trial; Reliability; Visual Information; Association; Attention; Bank Account; Computer Interface; Decision Making; Information Processing; Knowledge; Photostimulation; Psychology; Reproducibility; Task Performance; Young Adult; Attention; Banking, Personal; Cues; Data Display; Decision Making; Decision Support Techniques; Female; Fraud; Humans; Knowledge; Male; Photic Stimulation; Reproducibility Of Results; Task Performance And Analysis; User-computer Interface; Young Adult","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Decision making; Reliability; Decision quality; Decision support system (DSSs); Decision supports; Financial fraud detections; Information sources; Joint decision making; Reliability level; Visual information; Decision support systems; adult; article; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; decision support system; female; foraging; fraud; human; human experiment; male; randomized controlled trial; reliability; visual information; association; attention; bank account; computer interface; decision making; information processing; knowledge; photostimulation; psychology; reproducibility; task performance; young adult; Attention; Banking, Personal; Cues; Data Display; Decision Making; Decision Support Techniques; Female; Fraud; Humans; Knowledge; Male; Photic Stimulation; Reproducibility of Results; Task Performance and Analysis; User-Computer Interface; Young Adult","","","Funding text 1: We would like to thank all of our participants for their time, Joanne Claire Kitchen for her help with mobilising participants and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive feedback on the original manuscript draft.

In this work, we employ a series of modeling techniques to predict bank insolvencies on a sample of US-based financial institutions. Our empirical results indicate that the method of Random Forests (RF) has a superior out-of-sample and out-of-time predictive performance, with Neural Networks also performing almost equally well as RF in out-of-time samples. These conclusions are drawn not only by comparison with broadly used bank failure models, such as Logistic, but also by comparison with other advanced machine learning techniques. Furthermore, our results illustrate that in the CAMELS evaluation framework, metrics related to earnings and capital constitute the factors with higher marginal contribution to the prediction of bank failures. Finally, we assess the generalization of our model by providing a case study to a sample of major European banks. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank's Insolvencies; Conditional Inference Trees; Forecasting; Neural Networks; Random Forests; Support Vector Machines","","","","","Identifying Excessive Credit Growth and Leverage, (2014); Dealing with Imbalanced Data Undersampling Oversampling and Proper Cross Validation, (2015); Altman, Edward I., FINANCIAL RATIOS, DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS AND THE PREDICTION OF CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY, Journal of Finance, 23, 4, pp. 589-609, (1968); Bank Risk During the Financial Crisis do Business Models Matter, (2011); undefined, (2018); Journal of Information Engineering and Applications, (2013); Berger, Allen N., How does capital affect bank performance during financial crisesα, Journal of Financial Economics, 109, 1, pp. 146-176, (2013); Betz, Frank, Predicting distress in European banks, Journal of Banking and Finance, 45, 1, pp. 225-241, (2014); Boyacioglu, Melek Acar, Predicting bank financial failures using neural networks, support vector machines and multivariate statistical methods: A comparative analysis in the sample of savings deposit insurance fund (SDIF) transferred banks in Turkey, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 2 PART 2, pp. 3355-3366, (2009); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","01692070","","IJFOE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080070172"

However, the manual classification of these comments is challenging due to their high volume and unstructured nature. The purpose of this paper is to develop a classification framework and machine learning model to overcome these limitations. Design/methodology/approach: The authors create a multi-dimensional classification framework for the online corporate reputation that includes six main dimensions synthesized from prior literature: quality, reliability, responsibility, successfulness, pleasantness and innovativeness. To evaluate the classification framework’s performance on real data, the authors retrieve 19,991 social media comments about two Finnish banks and use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify automatically the comments based on manually annotated training data. Findings: After parameter optimization, the neural network achieves an accuracy between 52.7 and 65.2 percent on real-world data, which is reasonable given the high number of classes. The findings also indicate that prior work has not captured all the facets of online corporate reputation. Practical implications: For practical purposes, the authors provide a comprehensive classification framework for online corporate reputation, which companies and organizations operating in various domains can use. Moreover, the authors demonstrate that using a limited amount of training data can yield a satisfactory multiclass classifier when using CNN. Originality/value: This is the first attempt at automatically classifying online corporate reputation using an online-specific classification framework. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking Industry; Machine Learning; Neural Networks; Online Corporate Reputation; Social Media","","","","This article forms part of a special section “Branding in the Digital Age”, guest edited by Vignesh Yoganathan, Stuart Roper, Fraser McLeay and Joana Machado.","Aaker, Jennifer Lynn, Dimensions of brand personality, Journal of Marketing Research, 34, 3, pp. 347-356, (1997); Abratt, Russell, Corporate identity, corporate branding and corporate reputations: Reconciliation and integration, European Journal of Marketing, 46, 7, pp. 1048-1063, (2012); Habibi Aghdam, Hamed, Guide to Convolutional Neural Networks: A Practical Application to Traffic-Sign Detection and Classification, pp. 1-282, (2017); Syed Alwi, Sharifah Faridah, Online and Offline Corporate Brand Images: Do They Differ?, Corporate Reputation Review, 10, 4, pp. 217-244, (2007); Argenti, Paul A., Reputation and the Corporate Brand, Corporate Reputation Review, 6, 4, pp. 368-374, (2004); Selvitys Panama Kohusta Karsinyt Nordea Joutui Huonomaineisten Yritysten Listalle Op N Maine Parani, (2016); Belbachir, Faiza, Using language models to improve opinion detection, Information Processing and Management, 54, 6, pp. 958-968, (2018); Machine Learning Hands on for Developers and Technical Professionals, (2014); Analyzing Qualitative Data Systematic Approaches, (2010); Boateng, Henry, Consumers’ attitude towards social media advertising and their behavioural response: The moderating role of corporate reputation, Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 9, 4, pp. 299-312, (2015)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","10662243","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074938098"

Among all businesses, the financial area has probably the biggest consumption of big data and information science strategies. It is relied upon to change the large credit and personal loan industry in the banking sector, in view of the bits of knowledge and insights it generates about borrowers who are hard to endorse. The aim for this project study is to evaluate the credit's default likelihood and risks through studying the authentic dataset obtained from the financial organizations with various customer attribute variables and then ordering the people into one of two classes: (a) Uncertain/Risky (b) Eligible/ seeming to satisfy the repayment in full. The strategy towards making this characterization requires understanding the consumers and their past record as a consumer through data exploration and correlations between the important features and loan status followed by applying various machine learning algorithms like random forest, logistic regression and support vector mean to estimate the accuracy levels of the trained dataset model to process future loans. The project can quicken the credit creation cycle, mitigate risks, and render loan approval quickly. Along these lines, analytics can quickly survey the dangers of giving a credit and help settle on the choice of sanctioning a specific request for loan in a capable way. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking Sector; Big Data Analytics; Credit; Customer Characterization; Feature Importance; Machine Learning","","","","","Çaliş, Asli, Data mining application in banking sector with clustering and classification methods, (2015); Dawood, Emad Abd Elaziz, Improve profiling bank customer's behavior using machine learning, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 109320-109327, (2019); IEEE Access, (2017); J Appl Environ Biol Sci, (2015); Yilan, (2015); Yadav, Shweta, Bank loan analysis using customer usage data: A big data approach using Hadoop, 2018-January, pp. 1-8, (2017); Li, Xin, Overdue prediction of bank loans based on LSTM-SVM, pp. 1859-1863, (2018)","","Science and Engineering Research Support Society ijbsbt@sersc.org PO Box 5014Sandy Bay TAS 7005 Tasmania","","","","","","22076360; 20054238","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084534471"

The Android spyware family UAPUSH was responsible for the most infections, and several of the top 20 most common Android malware were spyware. Simply put, modern spyware steals the basic information needed to fuel more deadly attacks such as ransomware and banking fraud. Not surprisingly, some forms of spyware are also classified as banking trojans (e.g., ACECARD). We present a data-driven characterization of the principal factors that distinguish modern Android spyware (July 2016-July 2017) both from goodware and other Android malware, using both traditional and deep ML. First, we propose an Ensemble Late Fusion (ELF) architecture that combines the results of multiple classifiers' predicted probabilities to generate a final prediction. We show that ELF outperforms several of the best-known traditional and deep learning classifiers. Second, we automatically identify key features that distinguish spyware both from goodware and from other malware. Finally we present a detailed analysis of the factors distinguishing five important families of Android spyware: UAPUSH, PINCER, HEHE, USBCLEAVER, and ACECARD (the last is a hybrid spyware-banking trojan). © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Android; Characterization; Machine Learning; Malware; Spyware; Banking; Computer Viruses; Deep Learning; Android Malware; Android Platforms; Banking Trojans; Key Feature; Late Fusion; Learning Classifiers; Multiple Classifiers; Principal Factors; Android (operating System)","Banking; Computer viruses; Deep learning; Android malware; Android platforms; Banking trojans; Key feature; Late fusion; Learning classifiers; Multiple classifiers; Principal factors; Android (operating system)","","","This work was supported in part by the Office of Naval Research via grants N00014-15-1-2007 and N00014-16-1-2896, the Army Research Office under grant W911NF1410358, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Science for Peace and Security (SPS) programme under grant G5319.

Perhaps, in order to remain competitive in the global race for AI supremacy without being typecast as stifling innovation, typically cautious financial regulators are unusually allowing the introduction of experimental AI technology into the financial sector, with few controls on the unprecedented risks to consumers and financial stability. Once an unregulated AI software causes serious economic harm, a public and regulatory backlash would lead to over-regulation that could harm innovation of this potentially beneficial technology. Artificial intelligence is rapidly influencing the financial sector with innumerable potential benefits, such as enhancing financial services and improving regulatory compliance. This article argues that the best way to encourage a sustainable future in AI innovation in the financial sector is to support a proactive regulatory approach prior to any financial harm occurring. This proactive approach should implement rational regulations that embody jurisdiction-specific rules in line with carefully construed international principles. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis Ltd. michael.wagreich@univie.ac.at","","","","","","17521440; 17521459","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085041464"

Monitoring networks of cabled observatories, along with other docked autonomous systems (e.g., Remotely Operated Vehicles [ROVs], Autonomous Underwater Vehicles [AUVs], and crawlers), are being conceived and established at a spatial scale capable of tracking energy fluxes across benthic and pelagic compartments, as well as across geographic ecotones. At the same time, optoacoustic imaging is sustaining an unprecedented expansion in marine ecological monitoring, enabling the acquisition of new biological and environmental data at an appropriate spatiotemporal scale. At this stage, one of the main problems for an effective application of these technologies is the processing, storage, and treatment of the acquired complex ecological information. Here, we provide a conceptual overview on the technological developments in the multiparametric generation, storage, and automated hierarchic treatment of biological and environmental information required to capture the spatiotemporal complexity of a marine ecosystem. In doing so, we present a pipeline of ecological data acquisition and processing in different steps and prone to automation. We also give an example of population biomass, community richness and biodiversity data computation (as indicators for ecosystem functionality) with an Internet Operated Vehicle (a mobile crawler). Finally, we discuss the software requirements for that automated data processing at the level of cyber-infrastructures with sensor calibration and control, data banking, and ingestion into large data portals. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Cabled Observatories; Crawler; Cyber-infrastructures; Data Banking; Ecological Indicators; Ecological Information Treatment; Imaging; Artificial Intelligence; Automation; Biodiversity; Cables; Complex Networks; Data Acquisition; Data Handling; Digital Storage; Ecosystems; Imaging Techniques; Observatories; Pipeline Processing Systems; Population Statistics; Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicles; Remotely Operated Vehicles; Stream Flow; Cabled Observatories; Crawler; Cyber Infrastructures; Ecological Indicators; Ecological Information; Autonomous Underwater Vehicles; Artificial Intelligence; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Protection; Marine Biology; Procedures; Artificial Intelligence; Conservation Of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Marine Biology","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Biodiversity; Cables; Complex networks; Data acquisition; Data handling; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Imaging techniques; Observatories; Pipeline processing systems; Population statistics; Remotely operated underwater vehicles; Remotely operated vehicles; Stream flow; Cabled observatories; Crawler; Cyber infrastructures; Ecological indicators; Ecological information; Autonomous underwater vehicles; artificial intelligence; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; marine biology; procedures; Artificial Intelligence; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Marine Biology","","","Funding text 1: This work was developed within the framework of the following project activities: ARIM (Autonomous Robotic sea-floor Infrastructure for benthopelagic Monitoring; MartTERA ERA-Net Cofound) and RESBIO (TEC2017-87861-R; Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovaci\u00F3n y Universidades; PIs: J.d.R, J.A.), and Generalitat de Catalunya with the Project Sistemas de Adquisici\u00F3n Remota de datos y Tratamiento de la Informaci\u00F3n en el Medio Marino (SARTI-MAR) under Grant 2017 SGR 371.; Funding text 2: Funding: This work was developed within the framework of the following project activities: ARIM (Autonomous Robotic sea-floor Infrastructure for benthopelagic Monitoring; MartTERA ERA-Net Cofound) and RESBIO (TEC2017-87861-R; Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovaci\u00F3n y Universidades; PIs: J.d.R, J.A.), and Generalitat de Catalunya with the Project Sistemas de Adquisici\u00F3n Remota de datos y Tratamiento de la Informaci\u00F3n en el Medio Marino (SARTI-MAR) under Grant 2017 SGR 371.","Earth System Science, (2000); Reid, Walter V.C., Earth system science for global sustainability: Grand challenges, Science, 330, 6006, pp. 916-917, (2010); Ruhl, Henry A., Societal need for improved understanding of climate change, anthropogenic impacts, and geo-hazard warning drive development of ocean observatories in European Seas, Progress in Oceanography, 91, 1, pp. 1-33, (2011); Danovaro, R., An ecosystem-based deep-ocean strategy, Science, 355, 6324, pp. 452-454, (2017); Open Journal of Ecology, (2012); Williams, Stefan B., Reflections on a decade of autonomous underwater vehicles operations for marine survey at the Australian Centre for Field Robotics, Annual Reviews in Control, 42, pp. 158-165, (2016); Moline, Mark A., Sensor fusion and autonomy as a powerful combination for biological assessment in the marine environment, Robotics, 5, 1, (2016); Rajan, Kanna, Towards deliberative control in marine robotics, 9781461456599, pp. 91-175, (2013); Nature, (2010); Nature, (2010)","","MDPI AG rasetti@mdpi.com Postfach Basel CH-4005","","","","","","14248220","","","32245204","English","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082519155"

Along with the increase of online transactions, the worldwide banking sector was forced to deal with or to encounter an unforeseen number of fraudulent activities, yet. Hence, rule-based systems were designed to mark the high-risk transactions and let the experts to confirm the fraudulent nature of such transactions. As a countermeasure, static nature of rule-based systems were exploited by the latest attacks to go undetected. Thus, researchers aimed at designing adaptive fraud detection systems utilizing mainly machine learning techniques with the very recent application of deep learning. However, they were focused on detecting fraudulent activities but, to the best of our knowledge, none of them delved into the better understanding the characteristics of fraudulent card transactions in order to produce more resilient models. Therefore, in this study, we built the biggest data set ever used in a research, consisting of 4B non-fraud and 245K fraud transactions contributed to by the 35 banks in Turkey. Consequently, we introduce and examine the performance of profile-based fraud detection models, namely card-type based model, transaction characteristics based model, and amount-based model. Also, we made temporal and spatial analysis on our data set to show the robustness of the proposed models against aging and zero-day attacks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amount Range; Amount-based Success Rate; Card-type; Fraud Detection; Profiling; Transaction Characteristics; Zero-day Attack; Crime; Deep Learning; Banking Sectors; Card Transactions; Fraud Detection System; Fraudulent Card Transactions; Machine Learning Techniques; Online Transaction; Temporal And Spatial; Zero Day Attack; Learning Systems","Crime; Deep learning; Banking sectors; Card transactions; Fraud detection system; Fraudulent card transactions; Machine learning techniques; Online transaction; Temporal and spatial; Zero day attack; Learning systems","","","This work was supported by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) under Grant 3170946.","Global Payment Cards Data and Forecasts to 2023, (2018); Latest Credit Card Fraud Statistics and Insights, (2018); Detection and Prevention Methods of Fraud in Banking, (2019); Abdallah, Aisha, Fraud detection system: A survey, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 68, pp. 90-113, (2016); Design and Implementation of A Fraud Detection Expert System Using Ontology Based Techniques, (2013); Laleh, Naeimeh, A taxonomy of frauds and fraud detection techniques, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 31, pp. 256-267, (2009); Brause, Rüdiger W., Neural data mining for credit card fraud detection, Proceedings of the International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence, pp. 103-106, (1999); Proceedings of Acts Mobile Summit, (1999); Fraud Management Systems in Telecommunications A Practical Approach, (2005); Sparrow, Malcolm K., License to steal: Why fraud plagues america's health care system, pp. 1-240, (2019)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101868486"

We believe that this data set could provide more useful information such as predicting whether a bank client could be approved for a loan. This is a critical choice that has to be made by decision makers at the bank. Building a prediction model for such high-stakes decision does not only require high model prediction accuracy, but also needs a reasonable prediction interpretation. In this research, different ensemble machine learning techniques have been deployed such as Bagging and Boosting. Our research results showed that the loan approval prediction model has an accuracy of 83.97%, which is approximately 25% better than most state-of-the-art other loan prediction models found in the literature. As well, the model interpretation efforts done in this research was able to explain a few critical cases that the bank decision makers may encounter; therefore, the high accuracy of the designed models was accompanied with a trust in prediction. We believe that the achieved model accuracy accompanied with the provided interpretation information are vitally needed for decision makers to understand how to maintain balance between security and reliability of their financial lending system, while providing fair credit opportunities to their clients. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decision Trees; Ensemble Learning; Loan Prediction; Machine Learning; Model Interpretation; Adaptive Boosting; Commerce; Decision Making; Forecasting; Marketing; Predictive Analytics; Direct Marketing; Machine Learning Techniques; Model Interpretations; Model Prediction; Prediction Model; Research Results; Security And Reliabilities; State Of The Art; Machine Learning","Adaptive boosting; Commerce; Decision making; Forecasting; Marketing; Predictive analytics; Direct marketing; Machine learning techniques; Model interpretations; Model prediction; Prediction model; Research results; Security and reliabilities; State of the art; Machine learning","","","","El Bouchti, Abdelali, Fraud detection in banking using deep reinforcement learning, pp. 58-63, (2017); Mead, Adrian, Detecting fraud in adversarial environments: A reinforcement learning approach, pp. 118-122, (2018); Kataria, Sonal, Internet banking fraud detection using deep learning based on decision tree and multilayer perceptron, pp. 1298-1302, (2019); Kumar, Chhotu, Bank note authentication using decision tree rules and machine learning techniques, pp. 310-314, (2015); Singh, Mrutunjay, Image Processing Based Detection of Counterfeit Indian Bank Notes, (2018); Moro, Sérgio, Using data mining for bank direct marketing: An application of the CRISP-DM methodology, pp. 117-121, (2011); Moro, Sérgio, A data-driven approach to predict the success of bank telemarketing, Decision Support Systems, 62, pp. 22-31, (2014); Ruangthong, Pumitara, Bank direct marketing analysis of asymmetric information based on machine learning, pp. 93-96, (2015); Islam, Md Shifatul, SMOTE Approach for Predicting the Success of Bank Telemarketing, (2019); Asare-Frempong, Justice, Predicting customer response to bank direct telemarketing campaign, 2017-January, pp. 1-4, (2017)","","North Atlantic University Union NAUN","","","","","","19984464","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099311315"

It is applicable for all the business domains irrespective of the size of the business even including the start-ups. Because about 65% revenue for the organization comes from the existing customer. The goal of the customer attrition analysis is to predict the customer who is likely to exit or churn from the current business organization. In this research work, the literature review is carried out to explore the related work which has been already carried out in the field of customer attrition analysis. The literature review also focuses on some of the patents which are issued in the area of customer attrition or churn analysis. The goal of the research paper is to predict accurately the customer attrition rate in the Banking Sector. Objective: The main objective of this paper is to predict accurately the attrition rate in the Banking sector using an optimized deep feed-forward neural network. Methods: In the proposed work the predictive machine learning model is implemented using the optimized deep feed-forward neural network having five hidden layers in it. The model is trained using Adam optimizer algorithm to obtain the optimal accuracy. The Banking Churn data set is passed as input to the Optimized Deep Feed Forward Neural Network Model. In order to perform the comparative analysis, the same data set is passed as input to the other machine learning algorithm such as Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, and Artificial Neural Network. Results: The test results indicate that the proposed optimized deep feedforward neural Network model performed better in accuracy compared to existing machine learning techniques. Conclusion: The proposed optimized deep neural network model is an accurate model for customer attrition analysis in the Banking sector compared to the existing machine learning techniques. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking Sector; Customer Attrition; Data Exploration; Deep Feed Forward Neural Network; Machine Learning; Predictive Model; Banking; Decision Trees; Deep Learning; Deep Neural Networks; Forecasting; Learning Algorithms; Learning Systems; Logistic Regression; Multilayer Neural Networks; Predictive Analytics; Sales; Trees (mathematics); Business Modeling; Business Organizations; Comparative Analysis; Literature Reviews; Machine Learning Models; Machine Learning Techniques; Neural Network Model; Predictive Modeling; Feedforward Neural Networks","Banking; Decision trees; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Multilayer neural networks; Predictive analytics; Sales; Trees (mathematics); Business modeling; Business organizations; Comparative analysis; Literature reviews; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Neural network model; Predictive modeling; Feedforward neural networks","","","","Economics and Business Review, (2018); Hassani, Hossein, Digitalisation and big data mining in banking, Big Data and Cognitive Computing, 2, 3, pp. 1-13, (2018); Hatcher, William Grant, A Survey of Deep Learning: Platforms, Applications and Emerging Research Trends, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 24411-24432, (2018); Gaussian Process Behavior in Wide Deep Neural Networks, (2018); Detecting Statistical Interactions from Neural Network Weights, (2017); Tadić, Danijela P., A model for evaluation of customer satisfaction with banking service quality in an uncertain environment, Total Quality Management and Business Excellence, 29, 11-12, pp. 1342-1361, (2018); Keramati, Abbas, Developing a prediction model for customer churn from electronic banking services using data mining, Financial Innovation, 2, 1, (2016); Irjet, (2017); Ijritcc, (2017); Interdisciplinary Description of Complex Systems Indecs, (2016)","","Bentham Science Publishers","","","","","","18722121; 22124047","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097135719"

The results show that out of the various machine learning models, Random Forest which predicts the churn with 78% accuracy, is the most powerful model for the scenario. Customer vintage, customer's age, average balance, occupation code, population type, average debit amount, and an average number of transactions are found to be the variables with high predictive power for the churn prediction model. The commercial banks can deploy the model in order to avoid the customer churn so that they may retain the funds, which are kept by savings bank (SB) customers.

In particular, there is an indication that the inadequacy of a general approach to analyzing compliance documents impedes adequate compliance management practice. Taking an algorithmic-centric approach to tackling this challenge, this paper aims at providing an automated system that extracts, classifies and analyses compliance management documents in different domains. This paper tested and proposed machine learning techniques and systematically outlined algorithms for efficient extraction, classification and analysis of dataflow, control flow, and time constraints in compliance management domain for different stakeholders. The designed system was implemented using software tools. The classification was done in python Programming Language Environment using Machine Learning Algorithms while the Extraction and Analysis algorithms were implemented in Java programming language. Data were obtained from Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) and Nigeria Communication Commission (NCC). In the banking domain the authors chose Microfinance Banking system because it is a banking system that are commonly used by most government workers. Federal University of Agriculture Microfinance Bank was specifically chosen as a representative of all Microfinance Banks since they are all being guided by the same rules.

Clients were considered ""non-default"" or ""default"" depending on their default index, thus, 4 238 were considered ""non-default"" and 1 194 ""default"", including the information related to 10 variables (features) that composed the database. First, a random undersampling technique was applied to solve the unbalanced data problem. The variables were then coded in two ways: Code I (categorical variables) and Code II (binary or dummy variables). This was followed by the feature selection methods to detect the most important variables. Finally, we used three classifier algorithms of Machine Learning (ML), Bayesian Networks (BN), Decision Tree (DT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) comparatively. All these techniques were implemented in WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) software. The best performance was 95.2% using balanced classes, with the attributes coded in a binary way and the SVM machine learning technique. So, in this way, it is possible to automatically classify (""non-default"" or ""default"") new instances making use of the proposed methodology with high performance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classifier Algorithms; Credit Scoring Model; Feature Selection; Unbalanced Classes","","","","This study was partially financed by PUCPR and the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel Brazil (CAPES), and by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development ጀB razil.","Revista Contabilidade Financas, (2008); Rev do Bndes, (2010); Albuquerque, Pedro Henrique Melo, Geographically weighted logistic regression applied to credit scoring models, Revista Contabilidade e Financas, 28, 73, pp. 93-112, (2017); Steiner, Maria Teresinha Arns, Study of a medical problem using KDD, with emphasis on exploratory data analysis, Gestao e Producao, 13, 2, pp. 325-337, (2006); Thomas, Lyn C., A survey of credit and behavioural scoring: Forecasting financial risk of lending to consumers, International Journal of Forecasting, 16, 2, pp. 149-172, (2000); Puertas, Rosa, Análise do credit scoring, RAE Revista de Administracao de Empresas, 53, 3, pp. 303-315, (2013); Samejima, Kazuyuki, Inter-module credit assignment in modular reinforcement learning, Neural Networks, 16, 7, pp. 985-994, (2003); Doumpos, Michalis, Credit risk assessment using a multicriteria hierarchical discrimination approach: A comparative analysis, European Journal of Operational Research, 138, 2, pp. 392-412, (2002); Steiner, Maria Teresinha Arns, Extração de regras de classificação a partir de redes neurais para auxílio à tomada de decisão na concessão de crédito bancário, Pesquisa Operacional, 27, 3, pp. 407-426, (2007); Rev Econ, (2010)","","Scipedia S.L. claragarcia@scipedia.com","","","","","","02131315; 1886158X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092199921"

The deployed configuration is not reviewed/updated systematically and is handled manually by managers. Consequently, banks and companies are looking for systems and applications to automate and optimize their business processes and data management intelligently. In this context, the notion of integrating machine learning (ML) techniques in banking business processes has emerged. In order to build an intelligent and systematic solution, we combine in this paper ML and dynamic authorization techniques to enable performance-based policy evaluation into the banking teller process, where policies adapt to the changes recognized by the ML model. The objective of this work is to focus on the banking teller process that may be generalized to other operational banking processes. In this context, we propose in this paper a new model providing Intelligent Performance-Aware Adaptation of Roles and Policy Control using a support vector machine (SVM). We demonstrate that our model is capable of assessing the deployed control policies and updating them systematically with new roles and authorization levels based on tellers' performance, work history, and system constraints. We evaluated different machine learning models on a real dataset generated from a real-life banking environment.

In this paper, we develop an innovative complex network approach to simulate an interbank network with systemic risk contagion that takes into account the balance sheet of each bank, from which we can identify if the financial institutions have sufficient capital reserves to prevent risk contagion. Cascading defaults are also generated in the simulation according to different crisis-triggering (targeted defaults) methods. We also use machine learning techniques to identify the synthetic features of the network.

As part of measures to improve the banking sector and also restore customers' confidence, efficiency and performance analysis in the banking industry has become a hot issue. This is because stakeholders have to detect the underlying causes of inefficiencies within the banking industry. Nonparametric methods such as Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) have been suggested in the literature as a good measure of banks' efficiency and performance. Machine learning algorithms have also been viewed as a good tool to estimate various nonparametric and nonlinear problems. This paper presents a combined DEA with three machine learning approaches in evaluating bank efficiency and performance using 444 Ghanaian bank branches, Decision Making Units (DMUs). The results were compared with the corresponding efficiency ratings obtained from the DEA. Finally, the prediction accuracies of the three machine learning algorithm models were compared. The results suggested that the decision tree (DT) and its C5.0 algorithm provided the best predictive model. It had 100% accuracy in predicting the 134 holdout sample dataset (30% banks) and a P value of 0.00. The DT was followed closely by random forest algorithm with a predictive accuracy of 98.5% and a P value of 0.00 and finally the neural network (86.6% accuracy) with a P value 0.66. The study concluded that banks in Ghana can use the result of this study to predict their respective efficiencies. All experiments were performed within a simulation environment and conducted in R studio using R codes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Banking Crisis Bogs Roadmap for Clearing Ut Capital Bank Mess, (2018); Bog Collapses 5 Banks into Consolidated Bank Ghana Ltd, (2018); 19 Banks Meet New Capital Requirement, (2018); Predicting the Operational Efficiency of Banks in the Presence of Information Technology Investment Using Artificial Neural Network; Leo, Martin, Machine learning in banking risk management: A literature review, Risks, 7, 1, (2019); Hamid, Nurhayati, Efficiency measurement of the banking sector in the presence of non-performing loan, AIP Conference Proceedings, 1795, (2017); Intellectual Economics, (2016); Comparing the Efficiency of Islamic Banks in Malaysia and Indonesia; Asian Journal of Economic Modelling, (2015); Measuring the Efficiency of Islamic Bank in Indonesia and Malaysia Using Parametric and Nonparametric Approach","","Hindawi Limited 410 Park Avenue, 15th Floor, 287 pmb New York NY 10022","","","","","","16877101; 1687711X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089309258"

In Vietnam, this service can be seen as the objective for a potential card-less environment of payments. Although the service deployments are encouraged by many procedures from Government, there is still a limited number of E-Wallets‟ customers in the payment market. Some reasons are an inconvenient transaction infrastructure, or Vietnamese behaviors, etc. But the main problem leading to the reluctance of using E-wallet is security issue on online transactions such as personal information losses, or fake bank account or fraudulent transaction, etc. The advantage of using machine learning in transaction process can be seen as a good solution for securing customers‟ online payments. Machine learning classifiers such as Support Vector Machine, Radial Basis Function, and Decision Tree can help transaction systems to recognize fraudulent payments. This can be performed by classifiers‟ prediction from historical data. In this paper, a potential E-Wallet loan model using machine learning algorithms in Peer to Peer (P2P) business systems for Vietnamese Banks is shown. The dataset is taken from Vietnamese financial companies for experiments with alternative machine learning algorithms. The MASI dataset (data is re-organized with a reduction of its imbalance via algorithm) is also shown with better results. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","E-wallet; Financial Data; Imbalance; Machine Learning; Online Transaction; P2p","","","","","Leite-Castro, Cristiano Leite, Supervised learning with imbalanced data sets: An overview, Controle and Automacao, 22, 5, pp. 441-466, (2011); Cortes, Corinna, Support-Vector Networks, Machine Learning, 20, 3, pp. 273-297, (1995); Ngai, Wai Ting Eric, The application of data mining techniques in financial fraud detection: A classification framework and an academic review of literature, Decision Support Systems, 50, 3, pp. 559-569, (2011); undefined, (2018); Archives of Psychology, (1932); E Wallet Services in Fierce Competition for Vietnamese Consumers, (2018); Banks Raise Fees E Wallet to Be Preferred, (2018); Introduction to Radial Basis Function Networks, (1996); C4 5 Programs for Machine Learning, (1993); International Journal of Intelligent Systems and Applications Ijisa, (2019)","","Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc. dheep.infotel@gmail.com","","","","","","1943023X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088786600"

We develop textsf {FARM} , a Feature transformation based AndRoid Malware detector. textsf {FARM} takes well-known features for Android malware detection and introduces three new types of feature transformations that transform these features irreversibly into a new feature domain. We first test textsf {FARM} on 6 Android classification problems separating goodware and 'other malware' from 3 classes of malware: rooting malware, spyware, and banking trojans. We show that textsf {FARM} beats standard baselines when no attacks occur. Though we cannot guess all possible attacks that an adversary might use, we propose three realistic attacks on textsf {FARM} and show that textsf {FARM} is very robust to these attacks in all classification problems. Additionally, textsf {FARM} has automatically identified two malware samples which were not previously classified as rooting malware by any of the 61 anti-viruses on VirusTotal.

These techniques are used mainly for prediction, classification and partitioning data into different groups according to a certain common characteristic. In this work, we are interested in machine learning techniques for credit scoring and bankruptcy prediction in finance and banking. We evaluate and compare a range of machine learning techniques on several datasets issued from banks and financial institutions where the aim is to select the most appropriate methods suitable for each dataset. We use several metrics to evaluate the performance of the obtained models. The empirical studies are conducted on German, Australian, Japanese, Polish, Indian Qualitative Bankruptcy and Taiwan datasets. Also, we consider the huge 'Give Me Some Credit dataset'. The machine learning methods produce scores for applicants and companies and help a lot in the decision making. In other words, these methods permit us to distinguish between bad and good applicants or companies. The numerical study shows that there is no method able to consistently outperform the others on all the datasets. Also, there are significant differences between the studied methods on some datasets. For German and Give Me Some Credit datasets, the Bayes net method is able to produce good scores compared to the others studied methods. The LogitBoost method is competitive on both Polish and Australian datasets, while AdaBoost method is most appropriate for Japanese dataset. For Taiwan dataset, Random Forest method gives the best results compared to the other considered techniques. However, on Indian Qualitative Bankruptcy dataset, almost the methods are comparable due to the nature of this dataset. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking; Bankruptcy Prediction; Classification; Credit Scoring; Finance; Machine Learning","","","","","Abdou, Hussein A., CREDIT SCORING, STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES AND EVALUATION CRITERIA: A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE, Intelligent Systems in Accounting, Finance and Management, 18, 2-3, pp. 59-88, (2011); Abdou, Hussein A., Genetic programming for credit scoring: The case of Egyptian public sector banks, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 9, pp. 11402-11417, (2009); Abellán, Joaquín, Improving experimental studies about ensembles of classifiers for bankruptcy prediction and credit scoring, Expert Systems with Applications, 41, 8, pp. 3825-3830, (2014); Bellotti, Anthony Graham, Support vector machines for credit scoring and discovery of significant features, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 2 PART 2, pp. 3302-3308, (2009); Classification and Regression Trees, (1984); Breiman, Leo, Bagging predictors, Machine Learning, 24, 2, pp. 123-140, (1996); Proceedings of Aueirc 2017, (2017); Dalila, Boughaci, A new variable selection method applied to credit coring, Algorithmic Finance, 7, 1-2, pp. 43-52, (2018); Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B, (1958); Desai, Vijay S., A comparison of neural networks and linear scoring models in the credit union environment, European Journal of Operational Research, 95, 1, pp. 24-37, (1996)","","IOS Press Nieuwe Hemweg 6B Amsterdam 1013 BG","","","","","","15697371; 18759173","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085753803"

However, information in short texts is often insufficient, due, for example, to the use of mnemonics, which makes them hard to classify. Therefore, the particularities of specific domains must be exploited. In this article we describe a novel system that combines Natural Language Processing techniques with Machine Learning algorithms to classify banking transaction descriptions for personal finance management, a problem that was not previously considered in the literature. We trained and tested that system on a labelled dataset with real customer transactions that will be available to other researchers on request. Motivated by existing solutions in spam detection, we also propose a short text similarity detector to reduce training set size based on the Jaccard distance. Experimental results with a two-stage classifier combining this detector with a SVM indicate a high accuracy in comparison with alternative approaches, taking into account complexity and computing time.

It is also believed that financial institutions such as rural banks are powerful tools for mitigating poverty. Nevertheless, some of these banks are rather increasing the burden of people through illegal activities and mismanagement of resources. Assessing banks' performance using a set of financial ratios has been an interesting and challenging problem for many researchers and practitioners. Identification of factors that can accurately predict a firm's performance is of great interest to any decision-maker. The study used ARB's financial ratios as its independent variables to assess the performance of rural banks and later used random forest algorithm to identify the variables with the most relevance to the model. A dataset was obtained from the various banks. This study used three decision tree algorithms, namely, C5.0, C4.5, and CART, to build the various decision tree predictive models. The result of the study suggested that the C5.0 algorithm gave an accuracy of 100%, followed by the CART algorithm with an accuracy of 84.6% and, finally, the C4.5 algorithm with an accuracy of 83.34 on average. The study, therefore, recommended the usage of the C5.0 predictive model in predicting the financial performance of rural banks in Ghana. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Rural Banks, (2018); Proceedings of the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing Icaisc, (2019); International Journal of Academic Research in Accounting Finance and Management Sciences, (2013); Capital Bank Collapse Confidence in Banking Sector Still Strong Ofori Atta, (2017); Bog Shuts Down Dkm Microfinance, (2015); Interdisciplinary Journal of Contemporary Research in Business, (2013); Finanse Rynki Finansowe Ubezpieczenia, (2016); Delen, Dursun, Measuring firm performance using financial ratios: A decision tree approach, Expert Systems with Applications, 40, 10, pp. 3970-3983, (2013); Artificial Intelligence how Algorithms Make Systems Smart Wired; What is Machine Learning A Definition Expert System, (2017)","","Hindawi Limited 410 Park Avenue, 15th Floor, 287 pmb New York NY 10022","","","","","","16877101; 1687711X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081036524"

In this paper, we used a structured dataset of Santander bank, which is published on a data science and machine learning competition site (kaggle. com) to predict whether a customer would make a transaction or not? The dataset consists of two classes, and it is imbalanced. To handle imbalance as well as to achieve the goal of prediction with the least log loss, we used a variety of methods and algorithms. The provided dataset is partitioned into two sets of 200,000 entries each for training and testing. 50% of data is kept hidden on their server for evaluation of the submission. A detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) of datasets is performed to check the distributions of values. Correlation between features and importance of characteristics is calculated. To calculate the feature importance, random forest and decision trees are used. Furthermore, principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis are used for dimensionality reduction. We have used 9 different algorithms including logistic regression (LR), Random forests (RF), Decision tree (DT), Multilayer perceptron (MLP), Gradient boosting method (GBM), Category boost (CatBoost), Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive boosting (Adaboost) and Light gradient boosting (LigtGBM) method on the dataset. We proposed LighGBM as a regression problem on the dataset and it outperforms the stateof-the-art algorithms with 85% accuracy. Later, we have used fine-tune hyperparameters for our dataset and implemented them in combination with the LighGBM. This tuning improves performance, and we have achieved 89% accuracy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaboost; Banking; Catboost; Dimensionality Reduction; Dt; Eda; Gbm; Hyperparameter; Imbalanced; Lda; Ligtgbm; Lr; Machine Learning (ml); Mlp; Oversampling; Pca; Prediction; Rf; Santander; Skewed; Transactions; Unbalanced; Undersampling; Xgboost; Artificial Intelligence; Decision Trees; Discriminant Analysis; Forecasting; Learning Systems; Principal Component Analysis; Statistical Tests; Boosting Method; Category Boost; Dimensionality Reduction; Exploratory Data Analysis; Gradient Boosting; Gradient Boosting Method; Hyper-parameter; Imbalanced; Lda; Ligtgbm; Logistics Regressions; Machine Learning; Multilayers Perceptrons; Over Sampling; Pca; Santand; Skewed; Transaction; Unbalanced; Under-sampling; Xgboost; Adaptive Boosting","Artificial intelligence; Decision trees; Discriminant analysis; Forecasting; Learning systems; Principal component analysis; Statistical tests; Boosting method; Category boost; Dimensionality reduction; Exploratory data analysis; Gradient boosting; Gradient boosting method; Hyper-parameter; Imbalanced; LDA; LigtGBM; Logistics regressions; Machine learning; Multilayers perceptrons; Over sampling; PCA; Santand; Skewed; Transaction; Unbalanced; Under-sampling; Xgboost; Adaptive boosting","","","","Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Financial Services, (2017); Financial Analysts Journal, (1990); Cheng, Dan, A reinforced urn process modeling of recovery rates and recovery times, Journal of Banking and Finance, 96, pp. 1-17, (2018); Nian, Ke, Learning minimum variance discrete hedging directly from the market, Quantitative Finance, 18, 7, pp. 1115-1128, (2018); Renault, Thomas, Intraday online investor sentiment and return patterns in the U.S. stock market, Journal of Banking and Finance, 84, pp. 25-40, (2017); Seeja, K.

One of their main goals is to manage systemic risk, especially in the case of systemically important payment systems (SIPS) serving interbank funds transfers. We develop an autoencoder for the Sistema de Pagos Interbancarios (SPI) of Ecuador, which is the largest SIPS, to detect potential anomalies stemming from payment patterns. Our work is similar to Triepels et al. (2018) and Sabetti and Heijmans (2020). We train four different autoencoder models using intraday data structured in three time-intervals for the SPI settlement activity to reconstruct its related payments network. We introduce bank run simulations to feature a baseline scenario and identify relevant autoencoder parametrizations for anomaly detection. The main contribution of our work is training an autoencoder to detect a wide range of anomalies in a payment system, ranging from the unusual behavior of individual banks to systemic changes in the overall structure of the payments network. We also found that these novel techniques are robust enough to support the monitoring of payments’ and market infrastructures’ functioning, but need to be accompanied by the expert judgement of payments overseers. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anomaly Detection; Artificial Intelligence; Autoencoder; Machine Learning; Market Infrastructure; Neural Network; Retail Payments","","","","","Aggarwal, Charu C., Outlier detection for high dimensional data, SIGMOD Record, 30, 2, pp. 37-46, (2001); Aleskerov, Emin, CARDWATCH: A neural network based database mining system for credit card fraud detection, pp. 220-226, (1997); Kdd, (1996); Outliers in Statistical Data, (1994); Brause, Rüdiger W., Neural data mining for credit card fraud detection, Proceedings of the International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence, pp. 103-106, (1999); Chandola, Varun, Anomaly detection: A survey, ACM Computing Surveys, 41, 3, (2009); undefined; Dorronsoro, José Ramόn, Neural fraud detection in credit card operations, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 8, 4, pp. 827-834, (1997); Phil Mag Fifth Series, (1887); Ghosh, Sushmito, Credit card fraud detection with a neural-network, Proceedings of the Hawaii International Conference on System Science, 3, pp. 621-630, (1994)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","26661438","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000952016"

We then use the representation to compare the coherence of out-of-sample payment patterns of the same institution to its characteristic patterns. The performance is remarkable, with an out-of-sample classification error around three percent. The performance is robust to reductions in the number of features by unsupervised feature selection.

We compare a benchmark logit approach to several machine learning approaches recently proposed in the literature. We find that while machine learning methods often attain a very high in-sample fit, they are outperformed by the logit approach in recursive out-of-sample evaluations. This result is robust to the choice of performance metric, crisis definition, preference parameter, and sample length, as well as to using different sets of variables and data transformations. Thus, our paper suggests that further enhancements to machine learning early warning models are needed before they are able to offer a substantial value-added for predicting systemic banking crises. Conventional logit models appear to use the available information already fairly efficiently, and would for instance have been able to predict the 2007/2008 financial crisis out-of-sample for many countries. In line with economic intuition, these models identify credit expansions, asset price booms and external imbalances as key predictors of systemic banking crises. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Early Warning System; Logit; Machine Learning; Systemic Banking Crises","","","","Funding text 1: We thank Marisa Basten, Tobias Berg, Mathias Drehmann, Daniel Fricke, Christoph Memmel, Norbert Metiu, Peter Sarlin, Christian Schumacher, Makram El Shagi, Felix Thierfelder, Benjamin Weigert as well as the anonymous referees and seminar participants at the Bundesbank for many helpful comments.

This increasing popularity in online banking services and payment systems has created motivation for financial attackers to steal customer’s credentials and money. Banking trojans have been a way of committing attacks on these financial institutions for more than a decade, and they have become one of the primary drivers of botnet traffic. However, the stealthy nature of financial botnets requires new techniques and novel systems for detection and analysis in order to prevent losses and to ultimately take the botnets down. TrickBot, which specifically threatens businesses in the financial sector and their customers, has been behind man-in-the-browser attacks since 2016. Its main goal is to steal online banking information from victims when they visit their banking websites. In this study, we utilize machine learning techniques to detect TrickBot malware infections and to identify TrickBot related traffic flows without having to analyze network packet payloads, the IP addresses, port numbers and protocol information. Since command and control server IPs are updated almost daily, identification of TrickBot related traffic flows without looking at specific IP addresses is significant. We adopt behavior-based classification that uses artifacts created by the malware during the dynamic analysis of TrickBot malware samples. We compare the performance results of four different state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, Random Forest, Sequential Minimal Optimization, Multilayer Perceptron, and Logistic Model to identify TrickBot related flows and detect a TrickBot infection. Then, we optimize the proposed classifier via exploring the best hyperparameter and feature set selection. Looking at network packet identifiers such as packet length, packet and flag counts, and inter-arrival times, the Random Forest classifier identifies TrickBot related flows with 99.9534% accuracy, 91.7% true positive rate. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anomaly Traffic Detection; Banking Trojan; Dynamic Analysis; Machine Learning; Random Forest; Trickbot; Botnet; Computer Crime; Decision Trees; Dynamic Analysis; Electronic Commerce; Finance; Learning Algorithms; Learning Systems; Machine Learning; Malware; Online Systems; Optimization; Banking Trojans; Financial Institution; Machine Learning Techniques; Random Forest Classifier; Random Forests; Sequential Minimal Optimization; Traffic Detection; Trickbot; Internet Protocols","Botnet; Computer crime; Decision trees; Dynamic analysis; Electronic commerce; Finance; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Malware; Online systems; Optimization; Banking trojans; Financial institution; Machine learning techniques; Random forest classifier; Random forests; Sequential minimal optimization; Traffic detection; Trickbot; Internet protocols","","","I would like to thank TUBITAK-Directorate of Science Fellowships and Grant Programmes (BIDEB) to support my postdoctoral research project coded with 1059B191600549 application number.","Alshammari, Riyad, A flow based approach for SSH traffic detection, Conference Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, pp. 296-301, (2007); Black, Paul, A survey of similarities in banking malware behaviours, Computers and Security, 77, pp. 756-772, (2018); Breiman, Leo, Bagging predictors, Machine Learning, 24, 2, pp. 123-140, (1996); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Carminati, Michele, Security evaluation of a banking fraud analysis system, ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security, 21, 3, (2018); Criscione, Claudio, ZARATHUSTRA: Extracting Webinject signatures from banking trojans, pp. 139-148, (2014); Haddadi, Fariba, Benchmarking the Effect of Flow Exporters and Protocol Filters on Botnet Traffic Classification, IEEE Systems Journal, 10, 4, pp. 1390-1401, (2016); Ho, Tin Kam, The random subspace method for constructing decision forests, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 20, 8, pp. 832-844, (1998); undefined; Security Intelligence, (2016)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","01674048","","CPSED","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063635064"

This article emphasizes that banks should not abolish relationship banking, which nurtures close contact with bank customers. A long-term orientation of relationship banking streamlines incentives and supports the long-term needs of bank customers. However, banks might be lured into transaction banking due to the presence of IT-driven economies of scale and competition from FinTech start-ups and IT companies. In this light, the article evaluates the role of distances, artificial intelligence, and behavioral biases. Implications for stability in banking are explored.

Since the global financial crisis, risk management in banks has gained more prominence, and there has been a constant focus around how risks are being detected, measured, reported and managed. Considerable research in academia and industry has focused on the developments in banking and risk management and the current and emerging challenges. This paper, through a review of the available literature seeks to analyse and evaluate machine-learning techniques that have been researched in the context of banking risk management, and to identify areas or problems in risk management that have been inadequately explored and are potential areas for further research. The review has shown that the application of machine learning in the management of banking risks such as credit risk, market risk, operational risk and liquidity risk has been explored; however, it doesn’t appear commensurate with the current industry level of focus on both risk management and machine learning. A large number of areas remain in bank risk management that could significantly benefit from the study of how machine learning can be applied to address specific problems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank; Credit Scoring; Fraud; Machine Learning; Risk Management","","","","","Ala’raj, Maher, A new hybrid ensemble credit scoring model based on classifiers consensus system approach, Expert Systems with Applications, 64, pp. 36-55, (2016); Ala’raj, Maher, Classifiers consensus system approach for credit scoring, Knowledge-Based Systems, 104, pp. 89-105, (2016); Foundations of Banking Risk an Overview of Banking Banking Risks and Risk Based Banking Regulation, (2009); Arezzo, Maria Felice, Response-based sampling for binary choice models with sample selection, Econometrics, 6, 1, (2018); Efficient Learning Machines, (2015); Ssrn Electronic Journal, (2018); Moodys Analytics Risk Perspectives, (2017); Barboza, Flavio Luiz De Moraes, Machine learning models and bankruptcy prediction, Expert Systems with Applications, 83, pp. 405-417, (2017); Guidance on Paragraph 468 of the Framework Document, (2005); An Explanatory Note on the Basel II IRB Risk Weight Functions, (2005)","","MDPI AG membranes@mdpi.com","","","","","","22279091","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064808150"

However, in the financial domain expert-based credit risk models have still been dominating. Establishing meaningful benchmark and comparisons on machine-learning approaches and human expert-based models is a prerequisite in further introducing novel methods. Therefore, our main goal in this study is to establish a new benchmark using real consumer data and to provide machine-learning approaches that can serve as a baseline on this benchmark. We performed an extensive comparison between the machine-learning approaches and a human expert-based model-FICO credit scoring system-by using a Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) data. As the SCF data is non-synthetic and consists of a large number of real variables, we applied two variable-selection methods: the first method used hypothesis tests, correlation and random forest-based feature importance measures and the second method was only a random forest-based new approach (NAP), to select the best representative features for effective modelling and to compare them. We then built regression models based on various machine-learning algorithms ranging from logistic regression and support vector machines to an ensemble of gradient boosted trees and deep neural networks. Our results demonstrated that if lending institutions in the 2001s had used their own credit scoring model constructed by machine-learning methods explored in this study, their expected credit losses would have been lower, and they would be more sustainable. In addition, the deep neural networks and XGBoost algorithms trained on the subset selected by NAP achieve the highest area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy, respectively. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automated Credit Scoring; Decision Making; Internet Bank; Machine Learning; Sustainability; Algorithm; Assessment Method; Banking; Benchmarking; Comparative Study; Credit Provision; Decision Making; Empirical Analysis; Expert System; Hypothesis Testing; Internet; Machine Learning; Methodology; Sustainability","algorithm; assessment method; banking; benchmarking; comparative study; credit provision; decision making; empirical analysis; expert system; hypothesis testing; Internet; machine learning; methodology; sustainability","","","Funding text 1: Funding: This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) (No. 2017R1A2B4010826), by the Private Intelligence In-formation Service Expansion (No. C0511-18-1001) and by the Research Year of Chungbuk National University in 2016.; Funding text 2: The authors would like to thank reviewers for their suggestions to improve the manuscript.

As there is large amount of confidential data in banking the data need to be secured. Privacy regulations and other privacy concerns may prevent data holders from transferring information for performing data analysis to achieve a solution to this problem. Data mining techniques such as Clustering, KNN, SVM, Neural Networks are used these techniques are implemented to acquire more accuracy and provide better security for the data. Techniques like k-anonymity and l-diversity are having the drawbacks they do not provide appropriated privacy to the data. This paper presents methods where privacy and security of bank related sensitive data on one hand and resulting data set is mined without considerable loss in accuracy obtained in models. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classification; Clustering; Naïve Bayes; Neural Network; Random Forest","","","","","Rao, P.

One of the main factors needed in preparing of MRP is an accurate information about inflow and outflow. This study is to apply Deep Neural Network (DNN) for forecasting inflow and outflow in Indonesia and to compare its performance to ARIMAX as a simpler method and hybrid Singular Spectrum Analysis and DNN (SSA-DNN) as a more complex method. This study focuses on determining the best inputs in DNN, particularly for forecasting time series. A simulation study is used for evaluating the performance of each method related to the patterns in the time series. The real data are monthly inflow and outflow on 5 banknotes denominations from January 2003 to December 2016. The performance was evaluated based on Root Mean Square Error Prediction and Symmetry Mean Absolute Percentage Error Prediction criteria. The results of the simulation study showed that DNN yielded a more accurate forecast than ARIMAX and hybrid SSA-DNN in predicting time series with a trend, seasonal, calendar variation, and nonlinear noise patterns. Moreover, the results of inflow and outflow forecasting showed that DNN provided a more accurate prediction on most all banknotes denominations compared to ARIMAX and hybrid SSA-DNN. In general, these results show that DNN as machine learning model outperforms both ARIMAX as a simpler statistical model and hybrid SSA-DNN as a more complex model. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arimax; Dnn; Inflow And Outflow; Ssa-dnn; Time Series Forecasting; Accuracy Assessment; Artificial Neural Network; Banking; Computer Simulation; Forecasting Method; Input-output Analysis; Machine Learning; Numerical Model; Performance Assessment; Time Series; Indonesia","accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; banking; computer simulation; forecasting method; input-output analysis; machine learning; numerical model; performance assessment; time series; Indonesia","","","This research was supported by RISTEKDIKTI under Scheme B of World Class Professor (WCP) program, contract No. 123.32/D2.3/KP/2018.

This study aims to investigate factors that influence the attitudes and perceptions of digital natives pertaining to mobile banking and comfort interacting with AI-enabled mobile banking activities. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 218 digital natives. This paper uses multivariate regression and two separate multiple regression analyses to examine the differential effects of technology-based (i.e. attitudes toward AI, relative advantage, perceived trust and security in specific mobile banking activities) and non-technology based (i.e. need for service, quality of service) factors on mobile banking usage and AI-enabled mobile banking services. Findings: This study identifies determining factors for mobile banking and AI-enabled mobile banking services. Results indicate a divide in how digital natives perceive relative advantage between our two dependent variables. Consistent with previous studies, the relative advantage construct has the most impact on mobile banking usage. However, relative advantage was not significant for AI-enabled mobile banking, suggesting an extra layer of complexity that goes beyond convenient fast banking. Research limitations/implications: A limitation of this study is that it does not incorporate age groups outside of digital natives. Further research is needed to test for differential effects between age groups. In addition, the discovery of no significant impact of relative advantage on AI mobile banking warrants more research on the similarities and differences between mobile banking and AI-enabled mobile banking. Practical implications: To better appeal to digital natives, it is suggested that the banking industry emphasize mobile banking’s anywhere/anytime access to financial accounts, as this is important to college-age customers who may not live near their local banking institution. Moreover, the paper suggests that improvement to mobile banking features for one-on-one interpersonal contact with bank employees is needed. Originality/value: This study addresses the gap in the understanding of how digital natives perceive mobile banking in comparison to AI-enabled mobile banking services. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Financial Services; Human–computer Interaction; Mobile Marketing; Online Consumer Behavior; Services Marketing; Young Consumers","","","","","Al-Jabri, Ibrahim M., Mobile banking adoption: Application of diffusion of innovation theory, Journal of Electronic Commerce Research, 13, 4, pp. 379-391, (2012); Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, (2013); Babin, Barry J., Negative Emotions in Marketing Research: Affect or Artifact?, Journal of Business Research, 42, 3, pp. 271-285, (1998); Bhatt, Amola, Factors affecting customer’s adoption of mobile banking services, Journal of Internet Banking and Commerce, 21, 1, (2016); Brown, Irwin T.J., Cell phone banking: Predictors of adoption in South Africa - An exploratory study, International Journal of Information Management, 23, 5, pp. 381-394, (2003); Burleigh, Tyler J., Does the uncanny valley exist?

One form of this data transformation is automated chatbots that provide convenient access to data leveraged through a discussion-like interface. The purpose of this paper is to uncover how insurance chatbots support customers’ value creation. Design/methodology/approach: Three complementary theoretical perspectives – artificial intelligence, service logic, and reverse use of customer data – are briefly discussed and integrated into a conceptual framework. The suggested framework is further shown through illustrative case examples that characterize different ways of supporting customers’ value creation. Findings: Chatbots represent a new type of interaction through which companies can influence customers’ value creation by providing them with additional resources. Based on the proposed conceptual framework and the illustrative case examples, four metaphors are identified that characterize how insurance chatbots can support customers’ value creation. Research limitations/implications: The study is conceptual in nature, and the case examples are used for illustrative purposes. No representative data from those users who will eventually determine whether chatbots are of value was used.

Detection of banking Trojans remains a challenging task, due to the constant evolution of techniques used to obfuscate and circumvent existing detection and security solutions. Having a malware taxonomy can facilitate the design of mitigation strategies such as those based on evolutionary computational intelligence. Specifically, in this paper, we propose a cyber kill chain based taxonomy of banking Trojans features. This threat intelligence based taxonomy provides a stage-by-stage operational understanding of a cyber-attack, and can be highly beneficial to security practitioners and inform the design of evolutionary computational intelligence on Trojans detection and mitigation strategy.

Therefore, in the last few years, banks have upgraded their security to protect transactions from fraud. State-of-the-art solutions detect fraud as deviations from customers' spending habits. To the best of our knowledge, almost all existing approaches do not provide an in-depth model's granularity and security analysis against elusive attacks. In this article, we examine Banksealer, a decision support system for banking fraud analysis that evaluates the influence on detection performance of the granularity at which spending habits are modeled and its security against evasive attacks. First, we compare user-centric modeling, which builds a model for each user, with system-centric modeling, which builds a model for the entire system, from the point of view of detection performance. Then, we assess the robustness of Banksealer against malicious attackers that are aware of the structure of the models in use. To this end, we design and implement a proof-of-concept attack tool that performs mimicry attacks, emulating a sophisticated attacker that cloaks frauds to avoid detection. We experimentally confirm the feasibility of such attacks, their cost, and the effort required by an attacker in order to perform them. In addition, we discuss possible countermeasures. We provide a comprehensive evaluation on a large real-world dataset obtained from one of the largest Italian banks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fraud And Anomaly Detection; Mimicry Attack; Online Banking; Spending Pattern Granularity Analysis; Artificial Intelligence; Crime; Decision Support Systems; Economics; Large Dataset; Malware; Analysis System; Anomaly Detection; Detection Performance; Fraud Detection; Malwares; Mimicry Attack; On-line Banking; Security Evaluation; Spending Pattern Granularity Analyse; Spending Patterns","Artificial intelligence; Crime; Decision support systems; Economics; Large dataset; Malware; Analysis system; Anomaly detection; Detection performance; Fraud detection; Malwares; Mimicry attack; On-line banking; Security evaluation; Spending pattern granularity analyse; Spending patterns","","","This work has received funding from the European Union H2020 Programme, under grant agreement 700326 “RAMSES,” as well as from projects co-funded by the Lombardy region and Secure Network S.r.l.

This subjective component turns out to be large, especially for the low-rated countries. Countries that are rated as investment grade tend to be positively influenced by it, and vice versa.

The optimal control of a phenomenon such as liquidity risk requires a precise measurement method. However, liquidity risk is complicated and providing a suitable definition for it constitutes a serious obstacle. In addition, the problem of defining the related determining factors and formulating an appropriate functional form to approximate and predict its value is a difficult and complex task. To deal with these issues, we propose a model that uses Artificial Neural Networks and Bayesian Networks. The implementation of these two intelligent systems comprises several algorithms and tests for validating the proposed model.

And written assessment such as final examination accounts major component of assessment style in universities. It is a common sight that test or past examination papers along with some pre-defined parameters of test items such as time, question type, knowledge point, difficulty level and others are stored in the repository in the item test bank system. Very often, these exam papers are made accessible to learners to facilitate them for preparing final examination. Over time, there can be a lot of exam papers being accumulated for a particular subject and this may not feasible for learners to go through all of them due to time constraint. A better approach is to form groups or clusters of exam papers according to some attributes such as difficulty level and topics covered so that learners could choose limited number of exam paper to attempt from each group instead of all papers. This could eliminate the need for learners to search and attempt some exam papers that have high similarity and instead exposed to different level of difficulty of exam papers between groups. This requires the use of unsupervised machine learning approach particularly clustering technique to cluster past examination papers automatically according to keywords. These keywords may reflect some pertinent information such as difficulty level, topics covered and so forth. In light of this, this work proposes an enhancement to the existing framework of item test bank system by integrating the facility to cluster past examination papers. In the preliminary testing, the results indicate that clustering can be used to cluster exam papers into groups with a reasonable accuracy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Assessment; Bloom Taxonomy; Clustering; Difficulty Level; Item Test Bank System; Unsupervised Machine Learning","","","","","American Association for Artificial Intelligence 2005 Educational Data Mining Workshop, (2005); 2nd International Conference on Educational Data Mining Proceedings, (2009); Assessment in Education, (1998); Blooms Taxonomy, (2006); Exam Preparation Learning, (2014); Huang, Anna, Similarity measures for text document clustering, pp. 49-56, (2008); 6th International Symposium of Hungarian Researchers on Computational Intelligence, (2005); Merceron, Agathe, Clustering students to help evaluate learning, IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology, 171, pp. 31-42, (2005); Proceedings of International Conference on Data Mining, (2011); Proceedings of the Sixth Australasian Conference on Computing Education, (2004)","","American Scientific Publishers order@aspbs.com","","","","","","19366612; 19367317","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040861375"

Using an extensive dataset of messages posted on the microblogging platform StockTwits, we construct a lexicon of words used by online investors when they share opinions and ideas about the bullishness or the bearishness of the stock market. We demonstrate that a transparent and replicable approach significantly outperforms standard dictionary-based methods used in the literature while remaining competitive with more complex machine learning algorithms. Aggregating individual message sentiment at half-hour intervals, we provide empirical evidence that online investor sentiment helps forecast intraday stock index returns. After controlling for past market returns, we find that the first half-hour change in investor sentiment predicts the last half-hour S&P 500 index ETF return. Examining users’ self-reported investment approach, holding period and experience level, we find that the intraday sentiment effect is driven by the shift in the sentiment of novice traders.

The first stage of the methodology consists of grouping the companies in similar financial performance classes (e.g.: “good”, “average”, “poor” performance classes). We optimise the allocation of the observations within the performance clusters by applying an enhanced version of an observation re-allocation procedure proposed in our previous work. Next, based on the result of the grouping phase, we construct a performance class variable by attaching a performance label to each data row. Then, in the second phase of our methodology, we propose a feed-forward neural-network classification model that maps the input space to the newly-constructed performance class variable. This model allows us to forecast the performance of new companies as data become available. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Applications Of Fuzzy Sets; Artificial Intelligence; Classification; Knowledge-based Systems; Non-banking Financial Institutions; Performance Evaluation; Uncertainty Modelling","","","","","Abad-González, Julio, Can financial statements predict stress test results?

In addition to providing accurate measures of loss probabilities and credit risk, our models can also be used to analyze and compare risk management practices and the drivers of delinquency across banks. We find substantial heterogeneity in risk factors, sensitivities, and predictability of delinquency across banks, implying that no single model applies to all six institutions. We measure the efficacy of a bank's risk management process by the percentage of delinquent accounts that a bank manages effectively, and find that efficacy also varies widely across institutions. These results suggest the need for a more customized approached to the supervision and regulation of financial institutions, in which capital ratios, loss reserves, and other parameters are specified individually for each institution according to its credit risk model exposures and forecasts. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consumer Finance; Credit Card Default Model; Credit Risk; Machine-learning","","","","","Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Random Forests, (2001); Caruana, Rich A., An empirical comparison of supervised learning algorithms, 2006, pp. 161-168, (2006); Applied Statistics, (1992); Criminisi, Antonio, Decision forests: A unified framework for classification, regression, density estimation, manifold learning and semi-supervised learning, Foundations and Trends in Computer Graphics and Vision, 7, 2-3, pp. 81-227, (2011); Dietterich, Thomas G., Experimental comparison of three methods for constructing ensembles of decision trees: bagging, boosting, and randomization, Machine Learning, 40, 2, pp. 139-157, (2000); Witten, Ian H., Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, Third Edition, pp. 1-629, (2011); Journal of Credit Risk, (2008); Elements of Statistical Learning, (2009); Khandani, Amir Ehsan, Consumer credit-risk models via machine-learning algorithms, Journal of Banking and Finance, 34, 11, pp. 2767-2787, (2010)","","Elsevier","","","","","","03784266","","JBFID","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983412490"

From the practical perspective, the prediction of customer loyalty will provide a better understanding of Islamic banking that relates to customer loyalty and offer a platform that helps the bank management to improve the customer loyalty. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is the development of an artificial intelligence model for customers’ loyalty assessment in Malaysian Islamic Banking. To achieve this, first a returned of 373 from total 500 samples was collected via self administered questionnaires distributed by hand to customers at various Islamic bank branches around Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Second, the data analysis of the returned samples and testing with several statistical tools and methods was examined using SPSS. The data used were customer satisfaction, customer service quality, customer perceived value and customer trust which are the factors affecting customer loyalty. Third, assessment model was proposed and developed using an artificial neural network (ANN) based on cross validation for modeling customer loyalty. The decision of changing the ANN architecture is essentially based on prediction results to obtain the best ANN model computation to quantify customer loyalty. A statistical performance was conducted includes, root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient (COE) between the measured and estimated customer loyalty by the ANN. Experimental results obtained based cross validation with COE (0.9867) indicates that the third ANNmodel has better accurate results with fold 4 and trainLM [4 10 1] compared to others structures. Simulations results yielded significant results in predicting customer loyalty. In conclusion, this research has achieved its stated goal of developing an ANN model that provide quantitative assessment to facilitate Islamic banks managers in their effort to develop and implement successful customer loyalty strategies. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cross Validation Model; Customer Loyalty; Malaysian Islamic Banks","","","","","Levesque, Terrence J., Determinants of customer satisfaction in retail banking, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 14, 7, pp. 12-20, (1996); J Econ Psychol, (2006); Worcester, Robert M., Managing the image of your bank: The glue that binds, International Journal of Bank Marketing, 15, 5, pp. 146-152, (1997); Finance Week, (2005); Mokhtar, Hamim Syahrum Ahmad, Efficiency and competition of Islamic banking in Malaysia, Humanomics, 24, 1, pp. 28-48, (2008); International Journal of Economics and Finance, (2009); Haque, Ahasanul K.M., Factor influences selection of Islamic banking: A study on Malaysian customer preferences, American Journal of Applied Sciences, 6, 5, pp. 922-928, (2009); Rauyruen, Papassapa, Relationship quality as a predictor of B2B customer loyalty, Journal of Business Research, 60, 1, pp. 21-31, (2007); Zineldin, Mosad, The royalty of loyalty: CRM, quality and retention, Journal of Consumer Marketing, 23, 7, pp. 430-437, (2006); Journal of Management Research, (2013)","","Asian Research Publishing Network arpn@arpnjournals.com","","","","","","19928645; 18173195","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84967334658"

We classified and ranked the critical cloud security issues for banking organizations based on secondary and primary data. In this regard the cloud Delphi study is modified into three phases like identifying, analysis, and evaluating security issues. In this study, the samples of 40 panelists were selected from inside and outside Malaysian banking organizations based on their experienced in the banking environment to set the insight of the cloud issues. The study starts with a list of cloud security issues based on secondary data and interview. In addition, we illustrated the level of risk for all the cloud security issues in banking organizations as small, medium, and large risk. We also indicated that the highest risk of “Trusted cloud” in 3rd party (providers) and policies security issues and the highest risk of “Availability and Mobility” in application and program (software) security, etc. The study has been conducted on groups of cloud IT managers and cloud banking developers. As a future work, we will control and mitigate the critical security issues by using artificial intelligence techniques (ANN). A successful classification of critical cloud security issues will greatly improve the probability of cloud banking success rate. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cloud Banking Organization; Cloud Computing; Cloud Delphi Study; Cloud Deployment Models; Cloud Security Issues; Cloud Service Models; Application Programs; Artificial Intelligence; Cloud Computing; Distributed Database Systems; Artificial Intelligence Techniques; Cloud Computing Securities; Cloud Deployments; Cloud Securities; Cloud Service Models; Delphi Study; Secondary Datum; Security Issues; Societies And Institutions","Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Cloud computing; Distributed database systems; Artificial intelligence techniques; Cloud computing securities; Cloud deployments; Cloud securities; Cloud service models; DELPHI study; Secondary datum; Security issues; Societies and institutions","","","","Hoang, Doan B., Mobile Cloud for Assistive Healthcare (MoCAsH), pp. 325-332, (2010); Al-Anzi, Fawaz S., Cloud computing: Security model comprising governance, risk management and compliance, (2014); Int J Inf Technol, (2013); Int Manag Rev, (2014); Elzamly, Abdelrafe M., An enhancement of framework software risk management methodology for successful software development, Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, 62, 2, pp. 410-423, (2014); 4th National Conference on Software Engineering, (2002); Holzmann, Vered, Developing risk breakdown structure for information technology organizations, International Journal of Project Management, 29, 5, pp. 537-546, (2011); Mounzer, Jeffrey J., Integrated security risk management for IT-intensive organizations, pp. 329-334, (2010); Beckers, Kristian, Pattern-based support for context establishment and asset identification of the ISO 27000 in the field of cloud computing, pp. 327-333, (2011); Gao, Zhiwei, Management process based cloud service security model, 2013, 637 CP, pp. 278-281, (2013)","","Science and Engineering Research Support Society ijbsbt@sersc.org","","","","","","20054262","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027040852"

Providing good service quality is particularly important in highly competitive sectors where similar services exist. In this paper, focusing on banking sector, we propose an artificial intelligence system for building a model for the prediction of service quality. While the traditional approach used for building analytical models relies on theories and assumptions about the problem at hand, we propose a novel approach for learning models from actual data. Thus, the proposed approach is not biased by the knowledge that experts may have about the problem, but it is completely based on the available data. The system is based on a recently defined variant of genetic programming that allows practitioners to include the concept of semantics in the search process. This will have beneficial effects on the search process and will produce analytical models that are based only on the data and not on domain-dependent knowledge. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Analytical Models; Artificial Intelligence; Genetic Algorithms; Genetic Programming; Semantics; Telecommunication Services; Artificial Intelligence Systems; Banking Sectors; Beneficial Effects; Learning Models; Performance Aspects; Public Services; Service Quality; Traditional Approaches; Quality Of Service; Artificial Intelligence; Bank Account; Computer Simulation; Data Base; Evaluation Study; Human; Predictive Value; Semantics; Artificial Intelligence; Banking, Personal; Computer Simulation; Databases As Topic; Evaluation Studies As Topic; Humans; Predictive Value Of Tests","Analytical models; Artificial intelligence; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Semantics; Telecommunication services; Artificial intelligence systems; Banking sectors; Beneficial effects; Learning models; Performance aspects; Public services; Service Quality; Traditional approaches; Quality of service; artificial intelligence; bank account; computer simulation; data base; evaluation study; human; predictive value; semantics; Artificial Intelligence; Banking, Personal; Computer Simulation; Databases as Topic; Evaluation Studies as Topic; Humans; Predictive Value of Tests","","","","Casey, Eddie, Bank lending constraints, trade credit and alternative financing during the financial crisis: Evidence from European SMEs, Journal of Corporate Finance, 27, pp. 173-193, (2014); Iup Journal of Management Research, (2010); Lee, Peter K.C., An empirical study of transformational leadership, team performance and service quality in retail banks, Omega (United Kingdom), 39, 6, pp. 690-701, (2011); Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, (2013); Demirci-Orel, Fatma, Supermarket self-checkout service quality, customer satisfaction, and loyalty: Empirical evidence from an emerging market, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 21, 2, pp. 118-129, (2014); Li, Ling X., Relationships between determinants of hospital quality management and service quality performance - A path analytic model, Omega (United Kingdom), 25, 5, pp. 535-545, (1997); Procedia Economics and Finance, (2014); Bielen, Frédéric, Waiting time influence on the satisfaction-loyalty relationship in services, Managing Service Quality, 17, 2, pp. 174-193, (2007); Genetic Programming on the Programming of Computers by Means of Natural Selection, (1992); Koza, John R., Human-competitive results produced by genetic programming, Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines, 11, 3-4, pp. 251-284, (2010)","","Hindawi Limited 410 Park Avenue, 15th Floor, 287 pmb New York NY 10022","","","","","","16875265; 16875273","","","27313604","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84975088472"

Design/methodology/approach – Data are collected from 436 randomly selected customers at ten different branches of an Iranian bank using a questionnaire consisting of 51 questions. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is done on the collected data to determine those factors that influence customer satisfaction. A multilayer perceptron ANN model is developed using the factor scores from the EFA. The ANN model is trained and validated to predict overall bank customer satisfaction. In addition, a linear regression model is developed to predict customer satisfaction. Prediction accuracy of the ANN model is compared with that of the linear regression model. The developed ANN is then used to compare sensitivity of customer satisfaction to each influencing factor. Findings – Nine different influencing factors are extracted by EFA. The factors include Fees and Loans, Prompt Service, Appearance, Technological Service, Responsiveness, Reliability and Trustworthiness, Employees’ Attitudes and Behaviors, Accessibility to Bank and Availability of Service, and Interest Rates. Training and validation results show that the ANN model has 73 percent higher accuracy compared to the linear regression model in predicting overall bank customer satisfaction. Factor prioritization results show that Fees and Loans, Appearance, and Prompt Service have the highest impact on customer satisfaction, respectively; interest rate and accessibility to bank and availability of service are the least dominant factors influencing overall bank customer satisfaction. Practical implications – This study proposes a more reliable and accurate methodology to predict customer satisfaction when compared with regression-based methods. ANN can also be utilized by bank management systems to prioritize different influencing factors that affect the satisfaction level of bank customers. Originality/value – This paper advances the knowledge on bank customer satisfaction by proposing application of artificial intelligence methods.

Unfortunately, almost all of the existing approaches adopt black box models and mechanisms that do not give any justifications to analysts. Also, the development of such methods is stifled by limited Internet banking data availability for the scientific community. In this paper we describe BankSealer, a decision support system for online banking fraud analysis and investigation. During a training phase, BankSealer builds easy-to-understand models for each customer's spending habits, based on past transactions. First, it quantifies the anomaly of each transaction with respect to the customer historical profile. Second, it finds global clusters of customers with similar spending habits. Third, it uses a temporal threshold system that measures the anomaly of the current spending pattern of each customer, with respect to his or her past spending behavior. With this threefold profiling approach, it mitigates the under-training due to the lack of historical data for building well-trained profiles, and the evolution of users' spending habits over time. At runtime, BankSealer supports analysts by ranking new transactions that deviate from the learned profiles, with an output that has an easily understandable, immediate statistical meaning. Our evaluation on real data, based on fraud scenarios built in collaboration with domain experts that replicate typical, real-world attacks (e.g., credential stealing, banking trojan activity, and frauds repeated over time), shows that our approach correctly ranks complex frauds. In particular, we measure the effectiveness, the computational resource requirements and the capabilities of BankSealer to mitigate the problem of users that performed a low number of transactions. Our system ranks frauds and anomalies with up to 98% detection rate and with a maximum daily computation time of 4 min. Given the good results, a leading Italian bank deployed a version of BankSealer in their environment to analyze frauds. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decision Support System; Fraud Detection; Internet Banking; User Profiling; Artificial Intelligence; Crime; Economics; Electronic Commerce; Internet; Malware; Online Systems; Sales; Social Networking (online); World Wide Web; Computational Resources; Fraud Detection; Historical Profiles; Internet Banking; Real-world Attack; Scientific Community; Threshold Systems; User Profiling; Decision Support Systems","Artificial intelligence; Crime; Economics; Electronic commerce; Internet; Malware; Online systems; Sales; Social networking (online); World Wide Web; Computational resources; Fraud detection; Historical profiles; Internet banking; Real-world attack; Scientific community; Threshold systems; User profiling; Decision support systems","","","The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007–2013) under grant agreement nr. 257007 , as well as from the TENACE PRIN Project (n. 20103P34XC ) funded by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research .","Aggelis, Vasilis, Offline internet banking fraud detection, 2006, pp. 904-905, (2006); Proc of the 3rd Rapidminer Community Meeting and Conference Rcomm 2012, (2012); Annals of Mathematical Statistics, (1952); Banerjee, Amit, Validating clusters using the Hopkins statistic, IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems, 1, pp. 149-153, (2004); Bay, Stephen D., Detecting group differences: Mining contrast sets, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 5, 3, pp. 213-246, (2001); Stat Sci; Carminati, Michele, BankSealer: An online banking fraud analysis and decision support system, IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology, 428, pp. 380-394, (2014); Chandola, Varun, Anomaly detection: A survey, ACM Computing Surveys, 41, 3, (2009); Practical Nonparametric Statistics, (1980); Davies, David L., A Cluster Separation Measure, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, PAMI-1, 2, pp. 224-227, (1979)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","01674048","","CPSED","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84940722662"

Searches were performed in relevant journals resulting in 219 articles published between 2002 and 2013. To analyze such a large number of manuscripts, text mining techniques were used in pursuit for relevant terms on both business intelligence and banking domains. Moreover, the latent Dirichlet allocation modeling was used in order to group articles in several relevant topics. The analysis was conducted using a dictionary of terms belonging to both banking and business intelligence domains. Such procedure allowed for the identification of relationships between terms and topics grouping articles, enabling to emerge hypotheses regarding research directions. To confirm such hypotheses, relevant articles were collected and scrutinized, allowing to validate the text mining procedure. The results show that credit in banking is clearly the main application trend, particularly predicting risk and thus supporting credit approval or denial. There is also a relevant interest in bankruptcy and fraud prediction. Customer retention seems to be associated, although weakly, with targeting, justifying bank offers to reduce churn. In addition, a large number of articles focused more on business intelligence techniques and its applications, using the banking industry just for evaluation, thus, not clearly acclaiming for benefits in the banking business. By identifying these current research topics, this study also highlights opportunities for future research. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking; Business Intelligence; Data Mining; Decision Support Systems; Text Mining; Artificial Intelligence; Competitive Intelligence; Decision Support Systems; Statistics; Banking; Business Intelligence Applications; Customer Retention; Its Applications; Latent Dirichlet Allocation; Literature Analysis; Text Mining; Text Mining Techniques; Data Mining","Artificial intelligence; Competitive intelligence; Decision support systems; Statistics; Banking; Business intelligence applications; Customer retention; ITS applications; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Literature analysis; Text mining; Text mining techniques; Data mining","","","","Abbasi, Ahmed Ali, Metafraud: A meta-learning framework for detecting financial fraud, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 36, 4, pp. 1293-A12, (2012); Abdou, Hussein A., CREDIT SCORING, STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES AND EVALUATION CRITERIA: A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE, Intelligent Systems in Accounting, Finance and Management, 18, 2-3, pp. 59-88, (2011); Amayri, Ola, A study of spam filtering using support vector machines, Artificial Intelligence Review, 34, 1, pp. 73-108, (2010); Andersen, Julia, Journal impact factor in the era of expanding literature, Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection, 39, 6, pp. 436-443, (2006); Azadeh, Ali H., An intelligent decision support system for forecasting and optimization of complex personnel attributes in a large bank, Expert Systems with Applications, 39, 16, pp. 12358-12370, (2012); Ben-David, Arie, Accuracy of machine learning models versus ""hand crafted"" expert systems - A credit scoring case study, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 3 PART 1, pp. 5264-5271, (2009); Berger, Allen N., The economic effects of technological progress: Evidence from the banking industry, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 35, 2, pp. 141-176, (2003); Blei, David M., Latent Dirichlet allocation, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, 4-5, pp. 993-1022, (2003); Bragge, Johanna, Scholarly communities of research in multiple criteria decision making: A bibliometric research profiling study, International Journal of Information Technology and Decision Making, 11, 2, pp. 401-426, (2012); Chen, Hsinchun Chun, Business intelligence and analytics: From big data to big impact, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 36, 4, pp. 1165-1188, (2012)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09574174","","ESAPE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84908042352"

The Bayesian network, based on a previously developed causal framework, has been designed to model the smaller and more frequent, attritional operational loss events. Given the limited availability of risk factor event information and operational loss data, we rely on the elicitation of subjective probabilities, sourced from domain experts. Parameter sensitivity analysis is performed to validate and check the model's robustness against the beliefs of risk management and operational staff. To ensure that the domain's evolving risk profile is captured through time, a formal approach to organizational learning is investigated that employs the automatic parameter adaption features of the Bayesian network model. A hypothetical case study is then described to demonstrate model adaption and the application of the tool to operational loss forecasting by a business unit risk manager. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Banking; Bayesian Networks; Finance; Operational Risk; Probabilistic Methods; Artificial Intelligence; Finance; Human Resource Management; Knowledge Management; Learning Systems; Risk Assessment; Risk Management; Sensitivity Analysis; Value Engineering; Banking; Bayesian Network Models; Operational Risks; Organizational Learning; Parameter Adaption; Parameter Sensitivity Analysis; Probabilistic Methods; Subjective Probability; Bayesian Networks","Artificial intelligence; Finance; Human resource management; Knowledge management; Learning systems; Risk assessment; Risk management; Sensitivity analysis; Value engineering; Banking; Bayesian network models; Operational risks; Organizational learning; Parameter adaption; Parameter sensitivity analysis; Probabilistic methods; Subjective probability; Bayesian networks","","","Acknowledgements—The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided through two research grants awarded by the Department of Accounting and Finance, Monash University, and the Melbourne Centre for Financial Studies.

However, traditional machine learning methods assume that the training data and the test data are drawn from the same distribution, which is hard to be met in real world banking applications. This paper proposes a novel algorithm known as fuzzy refinement domain adaptation to solve this problem based on the ecosystem-oriented architecture. The algorithm utilizes the fuzzy system and similarity/dissimilarity concepts to modify the target instances' labels which were initially predicted by a shift-unaware prediction model. It employs a classifier to modify the label values of target instances based on their similarity/dissimilarity to the candidate positive and negative instances in mixture domains. Thirty six experiments are performed using three different shift-unaware prediction models. In these experiments bank failure financial data is used to evaluate the algorithm. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves predictive accuracy and outperforms other refinement algorithms. © 2012 IEEE. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank Failure Prediction; Banking Ecosystem; Domain Adaptation; Machine Learning; Algorithms; Ecosystems; Experiments; Mathematical Models; Bank Failure Prediction; Domain Adaptation; Long-term Prediction; Machine Learning Methods; Prediction Accuracy; Predictive Accuracy; Real-world Problem; Refinement Algorithms; Learning Systems","Algorithms; Ecosystems; Experiments; Mathematical models; Bank failure prediction; Domain adaptation; Long-term prediction; Machine learning methods; Prediction accuracy; Predictive accuracy; Real-world problem; Refinement algorithms; Learning systems","","","","Filev, Dimitar P., An industrial strength novelty detection framework for autonomous equipment monitoring and diagnostics, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 6, 4, pp. 767-779, (2010); Hunter, David, Selection of proper neural network sizes and architectures-A comparative study, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 8, 2, pp. 228-240, (2012); Semi Supervised Learning Literature Survey Computer Sciences, (2008); Nigam, Kamal, Text classification from labeled and unlabeled documents using EM, Machine Learning, 39, 2, pp. 103-134, (2000); Proceedings of the Sixteenth International Conference on Machine Learning, (1999); Maiti, Suman, An adaptive speed sensorless induction motor drive with artificial neural network for stability enhancement, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 8, 4, pp. 757-766, (2012); Fung, Gabriel Pui Cheong, Text classification without negative examples revisit, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 18, 1, pp. 6-20, (2006); Pan, Sinno Jialin, A survey on transfer learning, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 22, 10, pp. 1345-1359, (2010); Luis, Roger, Inductive transfer for learning Bayesian networks, Machine Learning, 79, 1-2, pp. 227-255, (2010); Arnold, Andrew, A comparative study of methods for transductive transfer learning, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, ICDM, pp. 77-82, (2007)","","IEEE Computer Society help@computer.org","","","","","","15513203","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84900559524"

Consequently, numerous statistical prediction models exist in the literature focusing on this particular subject. Besides, artificial intelligence techniques began to attain an increasing level of importance in the literature due to their predictive success. This study distinguishes itself from the similar ones in the sense that it presents a comparison of three different artificial intelligence methods, namely support vector machines (SVMs), radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs); in addition to subjecting the explanatory variables to principal component analysis (PCA). The extent of this study encompasses 37 privately owned commercial banks (17 failed, 20 non-failed) that were operating in Turkey for the period of 1997-2001. The main conclusions drawn from the study can be summarized as follows: (i) PCA does not appear to be an effective method with respect to the improvement of predictive power; (ii) SVMs and RBF demonstrated similar levels of predictive power; albeit SVMs was found to be the best model in terms of total predictive power; (iii) MLPs method stood out among the SVMs and RBF methods in a negative sense and exhibits the lowest predictive power. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bank Failure; Multilayer Perceptrons; Principal Component Analysis; Radial Basis Function Neural Network; Support Vector Machines","","","","","Bandalos, Deborah L., Four common misconceptions in exploratory factor analysis, pp. 61-87, (2008); International Journal of Intelligent Systems in Accounting Finance and Management, (1997); Gazi Universitesi Endustriyel Sanatlar Eitim Fakultesi Dergisi, (2005); Boyacioglu, Melek Acar, Predicting bank financial failures using neural networks, support vector machines and multivariate statistical methods: A comparative analysis in the sample of savings deposit insurance fund (SDIF) transferred banks in Turkey, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 2 PART 2, pp. 3355-3366, (2009); Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency, (2009); Canbaş, Serpil, Prediction of commercial bank failure via multivariate statistical analysis of financial structures: The Turkish case, European Journal of Operational Research, 166, 2, pp. 528-546, (2005); Bddk Bankaci Dotless Li Dotless K Ve Finansal Piyasalar, (2008); Iktisat Isletme Ve Finans, (2011); International Workshop III Mini Symposium on Application of Wavelets to Real World Problem, (2008); Hong, Wei Chiang, Rainfall forecasting by technological machine learning models, Applied Mathematics and Computation, 200, 1, pp. 41-57, (2008)","","","","","","","","15729974; 09277099","069112549X; 9780691125497","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84879933924"

Comparing different machine learning techniques it was found that Decision Trees outperformed the Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron and SVM. Out of all the techniques, Decision Tree is recommended for profiling studies because apart from obtaining high accurate results, it also yields 'if-then' classification rules.

Since the 1970s, many mathematical and statistical researchers have proposed prediction models on such issues. Given the recent vigorous growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and data mining techniques, many researchers have begun to apply those techniques to the problem of bankruptcy prediction. Among these techniques, the support vector machine (SVM) has been applied successfully and obtained good performance with other AI and statistical method comparisons. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been increasingly employed in conjunction with AI techniques and has provided reliable optimization capability. However, researches addressing PSO and SVM integration are scarce, although there is great potential for useful applications in this field. This paper proposes an adaptive inertia weight (AIW) method for improving PSO performance and integrates SVM in two aspects: feature subset selection and parameter optimization. The experiments collected 54 listed companies as initial samples from American bank datasets. The proposed adaptive PSO-SVM approach could be a more suitable methodology for predicting potential financial distress. This approach also proves its capability to handle scalable and non-scalable function problems. © 2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Financial Distress Prediction; Particle Swarm Optimization; Support Vector Machine; Adaptive Inertia; Ai Techniques; Banking Industry; Bankruptcy Prediction; Data Mining Techniques; Data Sets; Feature Subset Selection; Financial Distress; Financial Distress Prediction; Listed Companies; Optimization Capabilities; Parameter Optimization; Prediction Model; Artificial Intelligence; Finance; Forecasting; Particle Swarm Optimization (pso); Profitability; Research; Support Vector Machines","Adaptive inertia; AI techniques; Banking industry; Bankruptcy prediction; Data mining techniques; Data sets; Feature subset selection; Financial distress; Financial distress prediction; Listed companies; Optimization capabilities; Parameter optimization; Prediction model; Artificial intelligence; Finance; Forecasting; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Profitability; Research; Support vector machines","","","The authors thank the support of National Scientific Council (NSC) of the Republic of China (ROC) to this work under Grants No. NSC-99-2410-H-025-003 and NSC-99-2410-H-025-011.

Banks, the novels of the "" Culture series"" , in order to examine the role of artificial intelligences and the effects they could have on the life of a community from a political point of view. This series of science fiction novels portrays a galactic civilization based on anarchistic principles in which intelligent machines are largely responsible for managing the tasks linked to the handling of community affairs, thus freeing up the population to pursue more spiritual or fun activities. The first part of this paper shows that beyond the elements included in the stories, the Culture novels can be a way to address political questions that are raised by the widespread presence of highly evolved machines in the organization of a society. The second part, which takes into consideration the supposed founding principles of this civilization, examines the anarchist thought in order not only to display the correspondences between this thought and the vision of Iain M. Banks, but also to show that the various anarchistic currents are in a way outdistanced by the emerging challenges posed by these novels. The third part, written again from a political standpoint, attempts to establish more concrete connections, based on discernable evolutions in computerization or automation of technological systems, which seem to be working their way into a growing number of social processes and their regulation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anarchy; Artificial Intelligence; Civilization; Machines; Politics; Anarchy; Civilization; Fun Activities; Intelligent Machine; Machines; Politics; Science Fictions; Social Process; Technological System; Artificial Intelligence; Social Sciences; Artificial Intelligence; Automation; Civilization; Exploration; Heuristics; Political Organization","Anarchy; Civilization; Fun activities; Intelligent machine; Machines; Politics; Science fictions; Social process; Technological system; Artificial intelligence; Social sciences; artificial intelligence; automation; civilization; exploration; heuristics; political organization","","","","A Few Notes on the Culture, (1994); undefined, (2012); undefined, (2008); Post Scarcity Anarchism, (1971); Remaking Society Pathways to A Green Future, (1990); Bostrom, Nick, When machines outsmart humans, Futures, 35, 7, pp. 759-764, (2003); Brey, Philip A.E., Freedom and privacy in ambient intelligence, Ethics and Information Technology, 7, 3, pp. 157-166, (2005); Brown, Chris G., Special circumstances': Intervention by a liberal utopia, Millennium: Journal of International Studies, 30, 3, pp. 625-633, (2001); Callaghan, Vic, Some socio-technical aspects of intelligent buildings and pervasive computing research, Intelligent Buildings International, 1, 1, pp. 56-74, (2009); Rise of the Network Society, (1996)","","","","","","","","0160791X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84857189186"

By combining customer transactions and credit bureau data from January 2005 to April 2009 for a sample of a major commercial bank's customers, we are able to construct out-of-sample forecasts that significantly improve the classification rates of credit-card-holder delinquencies and defaults, with linear regression R2's of forecasted/realized delinquencies of 85%. Using conservative assumptions for the costs and benefits of cutting credit lines based on machine-learning forecasts, we estimate the cost savings to range from 6% to 25% of total losses. Moreover, the time-series patterns of estimated delinquency rates from this model over the course of the recent financial crisis suggest that aggregated consumer credit-risk analytics may have important applications in forecasting systemic risk. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consumer Credit Risk; Credit Card Borrowing; Household Behavior; Machine Learning; Nonparametric Estimation","","","","The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors only, and do not necessarily represent the views and opinions of AlphaSimplex Group, MIT, any of their affiliates and employees, or any of the individuals acknowledged below.

In this work, we focus on two of them: cash management in automatic teller machines (ATMs), and in the compensation of credit card transactions. In both cases a decision must be taken according to a future customers demand, which is uncertain. From historical data we can obtain a discrete probability distribution of this demand, which allows the application of stochastic programming techniques. We present stochastic programming models for each problem. Two short-term and one mid-term models are presented for ATMs. The short-term model with fixed costs results in an integer problem which is solved by a fast (i.e. linear running time) algorithm. The short-term model with fixed and staircase costs is solved through its MILP equivalent deterministic formulation. The mid-term model with fixed and staircase costs gives rise to a multi-stage stochastic problem, which is also solved by its MILP deterministic equivalent. The model for compensation of credit card transactions results in a closed form solution. The optimal solutions of those models are the best decisions to be taken by the bank, and provide the basis for a decision support system. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we propose an automatic classification model for issuer credit ratings, a type of fundamental credit rating information, by applying the support vector machine (SVM) method. This is a novel classification algorithm that is famous for dealing with high dimension classifications. We also use three new variables: stock market information, financial support by the government, and financial support by major shareholders to enhance the effectiveness of the classification. Previous research has seldom considered these variables. The data period of the input variables used in this study covers three years, while most previous research has only considered one year. We compare our SVM model with the back propagation neural network (BP), a well-known credit rating classification method. Our experiment results show that the SVM classification model performs better than the BP model. The accuracy rate (84.62%) is also higher than previous research. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In some cases, currency crises are followed by strong recessions (e.g., recent Asian and Argentinean crises), but in other cases they are not. This paper seeks to determine what are the most significant factors in explaining the consequences of currency crises on the economy. This paper collects data on 25 variables for 64 currency crises between 1970 and 1999. This research uses a novel algorithm with support vector machines (SVM) for selecting significant variables. This algorithm works well with datasets characterized by nonlinearity and low variable-observation ratio. Variables of banking size and fragility, international trade, and devaluation were the most significant. Variables of banking supervision, economic development, and IMF intervention were found less significant. The variable selection results of the algorithm were compared with all-best subsets variable selection. The results of our algorithm are more consistent with the economic literature than the results from all-best subsets. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Banking; Currency Crises; Machine Learning; Support Vector Machines; Variable Selection; Algorithms; Economics; Regression Analysis; Sensitivity Analysis; Banking; Currency Crisis; Support Vector Machines; Learning Systems","Algorithms; Economics; Regression analysis; Sensitivity analysis; Banking; Currency crisis; Support vector machines; Learning systems","","","","Edwards, Sebastian, Banks and macroeconomic disturbances under predetermined exchange rates, Journal of Monetary Economics, 40, 2, pp. 239-278, (1997); Economic Policy Review, (2000); Krugman, Paul R., Contractionary effects of devaluation, Journal of International Economics, 8, 3, pp. 445-456, (1978); Financial Regulation and Performance Cross Country Evidence, (1999); Carnegie Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy, (2000); 6th Int Meeting Latin American Caribbean Economic Association Montevideo Uruguary 2001, (2004); Corporate Insolvency Procedures and Bank Behavior A Study of Selected Asian Economies, (1999); Financial Crises in Emerging Markets, (2000); Kewley, Robert H., Data strip mining for the virtual design of pharmaceuticals with neural networks, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 11, 3, pp. 668-679, (2000); Computational Techniques for Modelling Learning in Economics, (1999)","","","","","","","","10834427","","ITSHF","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-2442606453"

This paper follows our earlier examination of neural networks (NN) (see Altman et al., 1994. Corporate distress diagnosis: Comparisons using discriminant analysis and neural network. Journal of Banking and Finance XVIII, 505-529). The experiments on GA were oriented along two different lines: the genetic generation of linear functions and the genetic generation of scores based on rules. The two types of experiments showed GA to be a very effective instrument for insolvency diagnosis, even if the results obtained with LDA analysis perhaps proved to be superior to those obtained from GA. Of particular interest, it should be noted that the results of GA were obtained in less time and with more limited contributions from the financial analyst than the LDA. Of additional interest is the relevance for credit risk management of financial institutions. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","C49; C88; Corporate Bankruptcy Risk; Discriminant Model; Distress Diagnosis; G33; Genetic Algorithm; Italian Firms","","","","","Corporate Financial Distress and Bankruptcy, (1993); Altman, Edward I., Corporate distress diagnosis: Comparisons using linear discriminant analysis and neural networks (the Italian experience), Journal of Banking and Finance, 18, 3, pp. 505-529, (1994); Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence, (1990); Genetic Algorithms in Search Optimization and Machine Learning, (1989); Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems, (1975); Machine Intelligence, (2025); Kingdon, Jason, Genetic algorithms and applications to finance, Applied Mathematical Finance, 2, 2, pp. 89-116, (1995); Genetic Programming, (1992); Machine Learning an Artificial Intelligence Approach, (1986)","","Elsevier","","","","","","03784266","","JBFID","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0007687443"

The decision to lend money to industrial companies is a complex and risky activity for financial institutions. They need much expertise to deal with the large amount of information that has to be considered for this process, and the analysis must be carefully done in order to avoid misjudgments that would result in severe losses of unrecoverable credit. An expert system named SPAC had been developed to deal with this task without fulfilling the user's expectations. This paper presents the drawbacks ofSPAC’s approach and how APT, an integrated machine learning system, has been used to acquire and refine domain knowledge and general decision rules from basic descriptions of cases provided by SPAC. The learning methodology is detailed, and a complete example of a learning session with APT is given.

After having presented (Section I) some of the fundamental challenges which the financial services industry puts onto decision technology, the motivations for the use of AI are related to a number of typical applications (Section II). This translates into suitable development and delivery environments (Section III), and to generic domain utilities required from shells or customized systems for that industry (Section IV). Markets and trades (Section V) are then shown to be well described in terms of knowledge representation and data structures, by object-oriented features embedded into logic programming environments. Conflict resolution strategies (Section VI), preference aggregation (Section VII), and revealed beliefs (Section VIII) are studied in detail as they represent cornerstones of the reasoning strategies used. A formal analysis of investment decision criteria (Section IX) demonstrates the complexity hereof, even with the help of search; an example from currency risk management (Section X) exemplifies this, while also demonstrating that sophisticated solutions can be built. Finally, intelligent information screens (Screens XI) are presented to stress the need for knowledge-based techniques in financial information retrieval, for fast selection of decision alternatives. © 1991 IEEE © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accounting; Banking; Conflict Resolution; Currency Management; Economics; Expert Systems; Finance; Information Screens; Insurance; Internal Rate Of Return; Investment Analysis; Natural Language Front-ends; Object-oriented Programming; Preference Aggregation; Reasoning; Revealed Beliefs; Data Processing, Business--financial Applications; Financial Services; Knowledge Representation; Artificial Intelligence","Data Processing, Business--Financial Applications; Financial Services; Knowledge Representation; Artificial Intelligence","","","","Capital Budgeting, (1951); Fairley, William B., INVESTMENT ANALYSIS USING THE PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION OF THE INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN., Management Science, 21, 12, pp. 1428-1437, (1975); Jean, William H., ON MULTIPLE RATES OF RETURN, Journal of Finance, 23, 1, pp. 187-191, (1968); Res Rep 7 1975, (1975); Inside Computer Understanding, (1981); Artificial Intelligence, (1991); Foundations of Decision Support Systems, (1981); Manager S Guide to Expert Systems, (1986); Planning and Understanding, (1983); Spicer and Oppenheim Guide to Understanding Financial Statements Around the World, (1989)","","","","","","","","10414347","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0026170756"
