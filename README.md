# AIML Banking Literature Review

This repository centralizes documents and datasets used for the AI and Machine Learning in Banking literature review undertaken at IIFT.

## Repository layout
- `Non 2024/` earlier drafts, presentations, and supporting data from the initial phase.
- `Non 2024/Archived/` superseded reference material retained for traceability.
- `Sep 2025/` the current working draft, curation spreadsheets, and supporting vocab files.

## Working guidelines
- Keep large source documents (DOCX, PPTX, PDF) in their respective period folders.
- Place any interim analyses or scripts alongside the inputs they rely on.
- Update this README whenever folder structure or workflows change.
- Before pushing, verify that confidential data is not present and that filenames reflect their contents and revision date.

## Next steps
- Document any data-cleaning or modelling scripts when they are added.
- Use feature branches for major edits to the manuscripts or datasets, then merge via pull requests.
